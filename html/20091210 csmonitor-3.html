      <h2>Police have presented a subversion case against prominent Chinese   dissident Liu Xiaobo, raising the likelihood that he will face trial and then   prison. The move furthers China's crackdown on democracy activists. </h2>
      <p>Beijing - Police investigators have presented   prosecutors with a subversion case against China's most prominent dissident,   lawyers for the activist, Liu Xiaobo, said on Wednesday. The move makes it more   likely that Mr. Liu will be sent to prison, despite widespread international   protests since he was detained without charge a year ago, human rights defenders   predicted. </p>
      <p>&quot;This significantly reduces Liu's chance of being released,&quot; says Nicolas   Bequelin, a China analyst with Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. &quot;It indicates   that the decision to bring him to trial has been taken by higher-ups.&quot; </p>
      <!--startclickprintexclude-->
      <!--endclickprintexclude-->
      <p>Liu's fate also indicates that &quot;the crackdown on human rights defenders â€¦   that started in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics remains at a heightened   level,&quot; says Roseanne Rife, Amnesty International's deputy program director for   Asia. &quot;The danger is now that it has become standard procedure.&quot; </p>
      <p>Liu, a literary critic and essayist, was <a href="p06s01-woap.html">detained on Dec. 8 last year</a>, apparently   for his role in drafting &quot;Charter 08,&quot; a call for greater democracy in China.   The charter, signed by 300 people, was published on the Internet two days later,   to mark the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It   has since attracted more than 8,000 signatures. </p>
      <p>Accused of &quot;inciting subversion of state power,&quot; Liu was held in a secret   location for six months before being formally arrested and transferred to   Beijing's Detention Center No.1 last June. Police extended their investigation   three times, the legal limit under Chinese law. </p>
      <p>Third time in jail </p>
      <p>This is the third time Liu, an outspoken critic of the Chinese regime, has   been jailed. He spent two years in prison for his role during the Tiananmen   Square protests in 1989, and three years in a &quot;reeducation through labor&quot; camp   for challenging one-party rule in Web postings. </p>
      <p>The prosecutor must now decide whether to drop the case, refer it back to the   police for further investigation, or bring it to court. </p>
      <p>He will &quot;most likely&quot; choose the third option, Liu's lawyer, Shang Baojun   says, although Chinese law allows for up to six months of procedural delays. </p>
      <p>If Liu is brought before a judge, &quot;it is impossible that he will not be   convicted,&quot; argues Mr. Bequelin. &quot;His arrest was political, his prosecution will   be political, and the outcome will be political,&quot; he charges. &quot;The legal   procedures are just a pipeline through which the case is processed, but the   outcome is decided elsewhere.&quot; </p>
      <p>Ignoring international pressure </p>
      <p>The decision by Chinese authorities to go forward with the case defies   international condemnation of their bid to brand pro-democracy activists as   subversives. Liu's arrest drew protests from leading authors around the world,   including Salman Rushdie, Umberto Eco, and Wole Soyinka. </p>
      <p>Until the prosecutor makes his decision, Liu's fate is not sealed, says   Bequelin. &quot;But time is running out,&quot; he says.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know whether international pressure helps,&quot; says Liu's lawyer, Mr.   Shang. &quot;But we cannot do nothing.&quot; </p>
