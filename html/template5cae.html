我们这个时代的曼德拉已死，在遭受了中国当局几十年骇人听闻的虐待之后，刘晓波至少现在找到了安宁。

享年61岁的刘晓波，是自纳粹时代以来，第一位在羁押中去世的诺贝尔和平奖获得者，他的死是对中国残酷对待一位现代伟人的指控。

就连在刘晓波罹患晚期癌症、频临死亡之际，中国仍拒绝让他出国接受可能挽救他生命的治疗。中国当局在没有得到他同意的情况下，给垂死的刘晓波拍下视频，制作描述给他仁慈待遇的虚假宣传片，这种做法愚不可及、令人作呕。

在接下来的几周里，中国可能会试图把刘晓波的遗体处理掉，而且是以不让他的坟墓成为民主朝圣地的方式。当局无疑会企图恐吓、威胁刘晓波勇敢的遗孀刘霞，也许为了不让她说话，会无限期地将她软禁。

西方领导人会为她说话吗？我认为恐怕不会，他们不会用比此前为刘晓波本人发声更强有力的声音为刘霞说话。

如果说，刘晓波死的方式是对中国压迫的控诉，他的死同时也突显了西方领导人的懦弱，他们太过胆怯，没有用任何有意义的方式来提出刘晓波的情况。特朗普总统在二十国集团首脑会议的间隙，在汉堡与中国国家主席习近平见了面，但特朗普根本没有提刘晓波的名字。惭愧呀，所有人。

刘晓波死得有尊严、死得光荣，他恪守了自己的原则。其他所有人，差了点劲。

有朝一日，在民主降临中国后，天安门广场上将有一个刘晓波的纪念碑。但在一个自由的中国里，永远不会有习近平的纪念碑，他在执政期间主持了对异见的严厉打压，大大地减少了中国的自由度。

下面是让那些不认识刘晓波的人略微了解一下他：

1. 他是一位出色的教员，1989年春，他正在哥伦比亚大学当访问学者，过得相当安逸。但在天安门的学生民主抗议活动开始的时候，他迅速回到国内，以对示威者表示支持。当军队在1989年6月3至4日的夜间向抗议者开火时，他原本可以逃离，但却留下来与军方协商，为仍在天安门广场中心的学生安排了一个安全离开的通道。在1990年代，他原本可以移居西方，但为了在自己的国家里为自由而奋斗，他没有走。

2. 他还有一个伟大的爱情故事，中国政府为了向他施压，凶残地对待他的妻子刘霞。刘霞在情感上已经很脆弱，虽然她从来没有被控犯有任何罪行，但她被置于软禁之中。中国政府知道刘晓波永远不会屈服，所以政府故意让他的妻子遭受巨大的隔离之苦，以此向刘晓波施压。然而，这对夫妇坚​​持了下来，他曾用优美的语言向她致意：“你的爱，就是超越高墙、穿透铁窗的阳光，抚摸我的每寸皮肤，温暖我的每个细胞，让我始终保有内心的平和、坦荡与明亮，让狱中的每分钟都充满意义。”

3. 异见者往往是不近情理的人，因为挑战一个高压国家有失去一切的风险，需要一种特殊的性格。刘晓波在职业生涯之初也不近情理，曾是一个少年得志、不可一世的学者，但在职业生涯的过程中，逐步变得温和、明智。他用以呼吁民主的《零八宪章》，就是这种明智的范例，他时常赞扬自己的办案者的专业精神，以明确地表示他并不厌恶他们——这正是我将他比作曼德拉的一个原因。

4. 习近平是否对刘晓波的死负有责任目前还不清楚，但很可能情况确实如此。虽然刘晓波死于肝癌，并曾患有肝炎（这是肝癌的一个危险因素），但中国监狱的医疗条件是臭名昭著地差，监狱当局常常拒绝为异见者提供医疗照顾，作为向其施加压力的一种方式。在我看来，很有可能如果他没有被监禁的话，刘晓波的癌症会在能够进行治疗的时候、更早地被发现。

5. 刘晓波在羁押中死亡，也为人们看到习近平让中国倒退了多远提供了一个窗口。在20世纪90年代及21世纪的部分时间里，刘晓波曾有过自由，能为海外刊物和互联网刊物写文章。（我最后一次和他通话是在2008年他被捕前不久，我在电话里报了自己的名字之后，国安人员就把电话掐断了）。习近平领导下的中国，比20年前的中国更不自由了。几天前，我曾给刘晓波写过一封公开信，将他描述为也许是我最敬佩的人，我真希望他看到了那封信——但我相信当局不允许他那样做。

6. 大多数中国人从未听说过刘晓波，因为国家宣传机器禁止关于他的讨论。于是就出现了这个矛盾的现象：因其在中国从事的工作而赢得诺贝尔奖的首位中国人去世了，但在他自己的土地上却没有多少哀悼他的人。但是，对我们这些在过去几十年中关心其无比重要和勇敢无畏的工作的人来说，有一种太多的空虚和悲伤感，主要不是为刘晓波本人感到悲伤，因为他现在已不再受迫害，而是为中国的大倒退感到悲伤，为世界领导人在一位现代伟人遭受野蛮对待时表现的胆怯感到悲伤。我们能够从刘晓波的勇气、正派和远见卓识上学到很多东西，我也期待着有朝一日可以在天安门广场上在他的纪念碑前献花。

Liu Xiaobo, We Miss You
By NICHOLAS KRISTOF July 14, 2017

The Mandela of our age is dead, and Liu Xiaobo will at least now find peace after decades of suffering outrageous mistreatment by the Chinese authorities.

Liu, 61, is the first Nobel Peace Prize winner to die in custody since the Nazi era, and his death is an indictment of China’s brutal treatment of one of the great figures of modern times.

Even as Liu was dying of cancer, China refused to allow Liu to travel for treatment that might have saved his life. In a move that felt crass and disgusting, the Chinese authorities filmed the dying Liu without his consent to make propaganda films falsely depicting merciful treatment of him.

In the coming weeks, China will probably try to dispose of Liu’s remains in a way that will prevent his grave from becoming a democratic pilgrimage spot. The authorities no doubt will attempt to bully and threaten Liu’s brave widow, Liu Xia, and perhaps confine her indefinitely under house arrest to keep her silent.

Will Western leaders speak up for her? I fear not, any more than they forcefully spoke up for Liu Xiaobo himself.

If the way Liu died is an indictment of China’s repression, it also highlights the cravenness of Western leaders who were too cowed to raise his case in a meaningful manner. President Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hamburg at the G-20- summit and did not even let the name Liu Xiaobo pass his lips. For shame, all around.

Liu Xiaobo died with dignity and honor, true to his principles. Everybody else, not so much.

Some day after democracy has come to China, there will be a memorial in Tiananmen Square to Liu. There will never be a memorial there in free China to Xi, who has overseen a harsh crackdown on dissent on his watch, leaving China substantially less free.

For those of you who don’t know Liu, a few glimpses of him:

1. He was a brilliant professor who in the spring of 1989 was a visiting scholar safely ensconced at Columbia University. But when the Tiananmen student democracy protests began, he rushed back to China to support the protesters. When the troops opened fire on protesters on the night of June 3-4, 1989, he could have fled but stayed to negotiate with the Army and arrange a safe exit for students from the center of Tiananmen Square. In the 1990’s as well, he could have moved to the West, but instead he stayed to fight for freedom in his own country

2. His was also a great love story, and the Chinese brutalized his wife, Liu Xia, to put pressure on him. Liu Xia was emotionally fragile, and although she was never even charged with any crime she was confined to house arrest. The Chinese government knew that Liu Xiaobo would never crack, so it deliberately inflicted great isolation and suffering on his wife to gain leverage over him. Yet the couple persevered, and he once wrote a beautiful tribute to her: “Your love is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window, stroking every inch of my skin, warming every cell of my body … and filling every minute of my time in prison with meaning.

3. Dissidents are often unreasonable people, for it takes something special to risk everything and challenge an oppressive state. Liu Xiaobo started out his career unreasonable, as an enfant terrible academic, but steadily became more moderate and reasonable in his career. His call for democracy, Charter 08, is a model of reasonableness, and he periodically complimented his persecutors on their professionalism to make clear that he did not resent them—and that is one reason I compare him to Mandela.

4. It’s not clear that President Xi bears responsibility for Liu’s death, but that may well be the case. Although Liu died of liver cancer and had had hepatitis, a risk factor, Chinese prisons are notorious for their poor medical care, and prison authorities often deny medical care to dissidents as a way of putting pressure on them. It seems to me quite plausible that Liu’s cancer would have been discovered earlier, when it was more treatable, if he had not been incarcerated.

5. Liu’s death in custody is also a window into how far backward Xi has taken China. For parts of the 1990’s and 2000’s, Liu was free and able to write for overseas and Internet publications. (I last spoke to him shortly before his arrest in 2008; State Security cut the phone connection after I identified myself.) China under Xi is less free than China was 20 years ago. I wrote an open letter to Liu a few days ago, describing him as perhaps the man I admire most, and I wish he could have seen it—but I’m sure the authorities did not allow him to do so.

6. Most Chinese have never heard of Liu Xiaobo, because the state propaganda apparatus has suppressed discussion of him. Thus the paradox: The first person to win a Nobel for work in China has died, and he is little mourned in his own land. Yet for those of us who followed his extraordinarily important and courageous work over the decades, there is a great sense of emptiness and sadness—not so much sadness for Liu himself, who is now free of persecution, but sadness for China’s backward march and sadness for the timidity of world leaders at the brutalization of one of the great men of modern times. There is so much we can learn from Liu’s courage, decency and vision, and some time I look forward to placing flowers at the memorial to him at Tiananmen Square.
