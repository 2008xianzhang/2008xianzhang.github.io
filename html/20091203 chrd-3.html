      <h4 align="left"><strong>As <em>Charter 08</em> Anniversary Nears, Liu Xiaobo Languishes Behind Bars without   Trial</strong></h4>
      <div align="left">(Chinese   Human Rights Defenders, December 3, 2009) On the official <a href="index-41.html" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a> of <em>Charter 08</em>, two numbers are   prominently displayed. One—over 10,000—documents the number of individuals who   have signed the document and lent their support to its call for democratization   and protection of human rights. The other—359—records the number of days the   intellectual and activist Liu Xiaobo (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">刘晓波</span>)   has been detained for leading the signature drive for <em>Charter 08</em> since he   was seized on December 8, 2008. <br/>
        <br/>
        December   9 will mark the one-year anniversary of the launch of <em>Charter 08</em>, and it   is an occasion which Liu will not be able to enjoy in the company of his fellow   citizens. On November 23, Beijing police notified Liu that the “investigation   period” of his case had been extended for an additional two months. Liu is   currently detained in Beijing’s Number One Detention Center, where he has been   since his formal arrest for &quot;inciting subversion of state power&quot; on June 23,   2009. Prior to his arrest, Liu was kept under “residential surveillance” at an   undisclosed location in Beijing.   <br/>
        <br/>
        The   “investigation period” of Liu’s case has previously been extended twice;   according to the Criminal Procedural Law, an “investigation period” may be   extended for a third and final time “in the case of a criminal suspect who may   be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of ten years at least” (Article 127). If   convicted of “inciting subversion of state power,” Liu faces a maximum of 15   years in prison. However, Chinese police do not always follow such legal   guidelines, especially when it comes to high-profile political cases like Liu’s. <br/>
        <br/>
        Liu   met with his lawyers Shang Baojun (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">尚宝军</span>)   and Ding Xikui (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">丁锡奎</span>)   on November 25 at Number One Detention Center to discuss the outlook of his   case. They were not optimistic. According to Shang, “the situation isn’t   very good.” He continued, “there is no need to hold him for so long during the   investigation period. What is there to investigate? All the articles have been   published online.” Shang speculates that, given the attention Liu’s case has   drawn and his status as a prominent intellectual and activist, China’s top   leaders have yet to decide how to handle his case, or perhaps officials are   dragging their feet because it is near the end of the year. <em></em><br/>
        <br/>
        While   the days when the Chinese government would release political prisoners as a   token gesture during visits from American heads of state are past, there was   some hope that Chinese leaders might make some quiet concessions following   Obama’s recent trip to Shanghai and Beijing, where Mr. Obama reportedly raised   Liu’s case in private meetings with Chinese leaders. However, days after Obama’s   departure, Liu's detention was extended. <br/>
        <br/>
        “This   shows plainly that President Obama's vague and general references to ‘universal   values’ and his ‘quiet diplomacy’ with the Chinese leaders have not paid off,”   said Renee Xia, CHRD’s International Director. “What is needed now is a clear   and strong statement from the United States and the international community that   the world will not look the other way as Chinese authorities abuse the rights of   their own citizens.” <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4><u>Recommendations:</u></h4>
        CHRD   demands the immediate release of Liu Xiaobo. <br/>
        <br/>
        Liu   has been detained for almost one year, without a trial, solely for the peaceful   activities of expressing his opinions and organizing fellow citizens to voice   their common concerns and ideas regarding the promotion of human rights and   democracy. Liu’s detention violates his rights to freedom of expression and   association enshrined in Article 35 of the Chinese Constitution and also   guaranteed in Articles 19 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and   Political Rights (ICCPR), which China has signed (though not ratified). His   detention is arbitrary, based on charges that he violated a vague law commonly   used to prosecute free speech.   <br/>
