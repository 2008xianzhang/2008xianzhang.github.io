        The following text of Charter 08, signed by hundreds of Chinese   intellectuals and translated and introduced by Perry Link, Professor of Chinese   Literature at the University of California, Riverside, will be published in the   issue of The New York Review dated January 15, which goes on sale on January   2.<br/>

        The document below, signed by over three hundred   prominent Chinese citizens, was conceived and written in conscious admiration of   the founding of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, where, in January 1977, more than   two hundred Czech and Slovak intellectuals formed a loose, informal, and open   association of people... united by the will to strive individually and   collectively for respect for human and civil rights in our country and   throughout the world.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The Chinese document calls not for   ameliorative reform of the current political system but for an end to some of   its essential features, including one-party rule, and their replacement with a   system based on human rights and democracy. <br/>
        <br/>
        The prominent citizens who   have signed the document are from both outside and inside the government, and   include not only well-known dissidents and intellectuals, but also middle-level   officials and rural leaders. They have chosen December 10, the anniversary of   the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as the day on which to express their   political ideas and to outline their vision of a constitutional, democratic   China. They intend &quot;Charter 08&quot; to serve as a blueprint for fundamental   political change in China in the years to come. The signers of the document will   form an informal group, open-ended in size but united by a determination to   promote democratization and protection of human rights in China and   beyond.<br/>
        <br/>
        On December 8 two prominent signers of the Charter, Zhang Zuhua   and Liu Xiaobo, were detained by the police. Zhang Zuhua has since been   released; as of December 9, Liu Xiabo remains in custody.<br/>

        ======================================== </span></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">I. Foreword</span></strong></p>
      <p align="left"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">A hundred years have passed since the   writing of China's first constitution. 2008 also marks the sixtieth anniversary   of the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the thirtieth   anniversary of the appearance of Democracy Wall in Beijing, and the tenth of   China's signing of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We   are approaching the twentieth anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre of   pro-democracy student protesters. The Chinese people, who have endured human   rights disasters and uncountable struggles across these same years, now include   many who see clearly that freedom, equality, and human rights are universal   values of humankind and that democracy and constitutional government are the   fundamental framework for protecting these values.<br/>
        <br/>
        By departing from   these values, the Chinese government's approach to &quot;modernization&quot; has proven   disastrous. It has stripped people of their rights, destroyed their dignity, and   corrupted normal human intercourse. So we ask: Where is China headed in the   twenty-first century? Will it continue with &quot;modernization&quot; under authoritarian   rule, or will it embrace universal human values, join the mainstream of   civilized nations, and build a democratic system? There can be no avoiding these   questions.<br/>
        <br/>
        The shock of the Western impact upon China in the nineteenth   century laid bare a decadent authoritarian system and marked the beginning of   what is often called &quot;the greatest changes in thousands of years&quot; for China. A   &quot;self-strengthening movement&quot; followed, but this aimed simply at appropriating   the technology to build gunboats and other Western material objects. China's   humiliating naval defeat at the hands of Japan in 1895 only confirmed the   obsolescence of China's system of government. The first attempts at modern   political change came with the ill-fated summer of reforms in 1898, but these   were cruelly crushed by ultraconservatives at China's imperial court. With the   revolution of 1911, which inaugurated Asia's first republic, the authoritarian   imperial system that had lasted for centuries was finally supposed to have been   laid to rest. But social conflict inside our country and external pressures were   to prevent it; China fell into a patchwork of warlord fiefdoms and the new   republic became a fleeting dream.<br/>
        <br/>
        The failure of both   &quot;self-strengthening&quot; and political renovation caused many of our forebears to   reflect deeply on whether a &quot;cultural illness&quot; was afflicting our country. This   mood gave rise, during the May Fourth Movement of the late 1910s, to the   championing of &quot;science and democracy.&quot; Yet that effort, too, foundered as   warlord chaos persisted and the Japanese invasion [beginning in Manchuria in   1931] brought national crisis.<br/>
        <br/>
        Victory over Japan in 1945 offered one   more chance for China to move toward modern government, but the Communist defeat   of the Nationalists in the civil war thrust the nation into the abyss of   totalitarianism. The &quot;new China&quot; that emerged in 1949 proclaimed that &quot;the   people are sovereign&quot; but in fact set up a system in which &quot;the Party is   all-powerful.&quot; The Communist Party of China seized control of all organs of the   state and all political, economic, and social resources, and, using these, has   produced a long trail of human rights disasters, including, among many others,   the Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957), the Great Leap Forward (1958–1960), the   Cultural Revolution (1966–1969), the June Fourth (Tiananmen Square) Massacre   (1989), and the current repression of all unauthorized religions and the   suppression of the weiquan rights movement [a movement that aims to defend   citizens' rights promulgated in the Chinese Constitution and to fight for human   rights recognized by international conventions that the Chinese government has   signed]. During all this, the Chinese people have paid a gargantuan price. Tens   of millions have lost their lives, and several generations have seen their   freedom, their happiness, and their human dignity cruelly   trampled.<br/>
        <br/>
        During the last two decades of the twentieth century the   government policy of &quot;Reform and Opening&quot; gave the Chinese people relief from   the pervasive poverty and totalitarianism of the Mao Zedong era and brought   substantial increases in the wealth and living standards of many Chinese as well   as a partial restoration of economic freedom and economic rights. Civil society   began to grow, and popular calls for more rights and more political freedom have   grown apace. As the ruling elite itself moved toward private ownership and the   market economy, it began to shift from an outright rejection of &quot;rights&quot; to a   partial acknowledgment of them.<br/>
        <br/>
        In 1998 the Chinese government signed two   important international human rights conventions; in 2004 it amended its   constitution to include the phrase &quot;respect and protect human rights&quot;; and this   year, 2008, it has promised to promote a &quot;national human rights action plan.&quot;   Unfortunately most of this political progress has extended no further than the   paper on which it is written. The political reality, which is plain for anyone   to see, is that China has many laws but no rule of law; it has a constitution   but no constitutional government. The ruling elite continues to cling to its   authoritarian power and fights off any move toward political change.<br/>
        <br/>
        The   stultifying results are endemic official corruption, an undermining of the rule   of law, weak human rights, decay in public ethics, crony capitalism, growing   inequality between the wealthy and the poor, pillage of the natural environment   as well as of the human and historical environments, and the exacerbation of a   long list of social conflicts, especially, in recent times, a sharpening   animosity between officials and ordinary people.<br/>
        <br/>
        As these conflicts and   crises grow ever more intense, and as the ruling elite continues with impunity   to crush and to strip away the rights of citizens to freedom, to property, and   to the pursuit of happiness, we see the powerless in our society—the vulnerable   groups, the people who have been suppressed and monitored, who have suffered   cruelty and even torture, and who have had no adequate avenues for their   protests, no courts to hear their pleas—becoming more militant and raising the   possibility of a violent conflict of disastrous proportions. The decline of the   current system has reached the point where change is no longer   optional.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">II. Our Fundamental   Principles</span></strong></p>
      <p align="left"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">This is a historic moment for China, and   our future hangs in the balance. In reviewing the political modernization   process of the past hundred years or more, we reiterate and endorse basic   universal values as follows:<br/>
        <br/>
        Freedom. Freedom is at the core of universal   human values. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly,   freedom of association, freedom in where to live, and the freedoms to strike, to   demonstrate, and to protest, among others, are the forms that freedom takes.   Without freedom, China will always remain far from civilized   ideals.<br/>
        <br/>
        Human rights. Human rights are not bestowed by a state. Every   person is born with inherent rights to dignity and freedom. The government   exists for the protection of the human rights of its citizens. The exercise of   state power must be authorized by the people. The succession of political   disasters in China's recent history is a direct consequence of the ruling   regime's disregard for human rights.<br/>
        <br/>
        Equality. The integrity, dignity,   and freedom of every person—regardless of social station, occupation, sex,   economic condition, ethnicity, skin color, religion, or political belief—are the   same as those of any other. Principles of equality before the law and equality   of social, economic, cultural, civil, and political rights must be   upheld.<br/>
        <br/>
        Republicanism. Republicanism, which holds that power should be   balanced among different branches of government and competing interests should   be served, resembles the traditional Chinese political ideal of &quot;fairness in all   under heaven.&quot; It allows different interest groups and social assemblies, and   people with a variety of cultures and beliefs, to exercise democratic   self-government and to deliberate in order to reach peaceful resolution of   public questions on a basis of equal access to government and free and fair   competition.<br/>
        <br/>
        Democracy. The most fundamental principles of democracy are   that the people are sovereign and the people select their government. Democracy   has these characteristics: (1) Political power begins with the people and the   legitimacy of a regime derives from the people. (2) Political power is exercised   through choices that the people make. (3) The holders of major official posts in   government at all levels are determined through periodic competitive elections.   (4) While honoring the will of the majority, the fundamental dignity, freedom,   and human rights of minorities are protected. In short, democracy is a modern   means for achieving government truly &quot;of the people, by the people, and for the   people.&quot;<br/>
        <br/>
        Constitutional rule. Constitutional rule is rule through a legal   system and legal regulations to implement principles that are spelled out in a   constitution. It means protecting the freedom and the rights of citizens,   limiting and defining the scope of legitimate government power, and providing   the administrative apparatus necessary to serve these ends.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">III. What We Advocate</span></strong></p>
      <p align="left"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Authoritarianism is in general decline   throughout the world; in China, too, the era of emperors and overlords is on the   way out. The time is arriving everywhere for citizens to be masters of states.   For China the path that leads out of our current predicament is to divest   ourselves of the authoritarian notion of reliance on an &quot;enlightened overlord&quot;   or an &quot;honest official&quot; and to turn instead toward a system of liberties,   democracy, and the rule of law, and toward fostering the consciousness of modern   citizens who see rights as fundamental and participation as a duty. Accordingly,   and in a spirit of this duty as responsible and constructive citizens, we offer   the following recommendations on national governance, citizens' rights, and   social development:<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>1. A New Constitution. </strong>We should recast our   present constitution, rescinding its provisions that contradict the principle   that sovereignty resides with the people and turning it into a document that   genuinely guarantees human rights, authorizes the exercise of public power, and   serves as the legal underpinning of China's democratization. The constitution   must be the highest law in the land, beyond violation by any individual, group,   or political party.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>2. Separation of powers. </strong>We should construct a   modern government in which the separation of legislative, judicial, and   executive power is guaranteed. We need an Administrative Law that defines the   scope of government responsibility and prevents abuse of administrative power.   Government should be responsible to taxpayers. Division of power between   provincial governments and the central government should adhere to the principle   that central powers are only those specifically granted by the constitution and   all other powers belong to the local governments.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>3. Legislative   democracy. </strong>Members of legislative bodies at all levels should be chosen by   direct election, and legislative democracy should observe just and impartial   principles.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>4. An Independent Judiciary. </strong>The rule of law must be   above the interests of any particular political party and judges must be   independent. We need to establish a constitutional supreme court and institute   procedures for constitutional review. As soon as possible, we should abolish all   of the Committees on Political and Legal Affairs that now allow Communist Party   officials at every level to decide politically-sensitive cases in advance and   out of court. We should strictly forbid the use of public offices for private   purposes.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>5. Public Control of Public Servants.</strong> The military   should be made answerable to the national government, not to a political party,   and should be made more professional. Military personnel should swear allegiance   to the constitution and remain nonpartisan. Political party organizations shall   be prohibited in the military. All public officials including police should   serve as nonpartisans, and the current practice of favoring one political party   in the hiring of public servants must end.<br/>
        <strong><br/>
          6. Guarantee of Human   Rights. </strong>There shall be strict guarantees of human rights and respect for   human dignity. There should be a Human Rights Committee, responsible to the   highest legislative body, that will prevent the government from abusing public   power in violation of human rights. A democratic and constitutional China   especially must guarantee the personal freedom of citizens. No one shall suffer   illegal arrest, detention, arraignment, interrogation, or punishment. The system   of &quot;Reeducation through Labor&quot; must be abolished.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>7. Election of   Public Officials. </strong>There shall be a comprehensive system of democratic   elections based on &quot;one person, one vote.&quot; The direct election of administrative   heads at the levels of county, city, province, and nation should be   systematically implemented. The rights to hold periodic free elections and to   participate in them as a citizen are inalienable.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>8. Rural–Urban   Equality. </strong>The two-tier household registry system must be abolished. This   system favors urban residents and harms rural residents. We should establish   instead a system that gives every citizen the same constitutional rights and the   same freedom to choose where to live.<br/>
        <strong><br/>
          9. Freedom to Form Groups. </strong>The right of citizens to form groups must be guaranteed. The current system   for registering nongovernment groups, which requires a group to be &quot;approved,&quot;   should be replaced by a system in which a group simply registers itself. The   formation of political parties should be governed by the constitution and the   laws, which means that we must abolish the special privilege of one party to   monopolize power and must guarantee principles of free and fair competition   among political parties.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>10. Freedom to Assemble. </strong>The constitution   provides that peaceful assembly, demonstration, protest, and freedom of   expression are fundamental rights of a citizen. The ruling party and the   government must not be permitted to subject these to illegal interference or   unconstitutional obstruction.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>11. Freedom of Expression. </strong>We should   make freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and academic freedom universal,   thereby guaranteeing that citizens can be informed and can exercise their right   of political supervision. These freedoms should be upheld by a Press Law that   abolishes political restrictions on the press. The provision in the current   Criminal Law that refers to &quot;the crime of incitement to subvert state power&quot;   must be abolished. We should end the practice of viewing words as   crimes.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>12. Freedom of Religion. </strong>We must guarantee freedom of   religion and belief and institute a separation of religion and state. There must   be no governmental interference in peaceful religious activities. We should   abolish any laws, regulations, or local rules that limit or suppress the   religious freedom of citizens. We should abolish the current system that   requires religious groups (and their places of worship) to get official approval   in advance and substitute for it a system in which registry is optional and, for   those who choose to register, automatic.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>13. Civic Education.</strong> In   our schools we should abolish political curriculums and examinations that are   designed to indoctrinate students in state ideology and to instill support for   the rule of one party. We should replace them with civic education that advances   universal values and citizens' rights, fosters civic consciousness, and promotes   civic virtues that serve society.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>14. Protection of Private Property. </strong>We should establish and protect the right to private property and promote an   economic system of free and fair markets. We should do away with government   monopolies in commerce and industry and guarantee the freedom to start new   enterprises. We should establish a Committee on State-Owned Property, reporting   to the national legislature, that will monitor the transfer of state-owned   enterprises to private ownership in a fair, competitive, and orderly manner. We   should institute a land reform that promotes private ownership of land,   guarantees the right to buy and sell land, and allows the true value of private   property to be adequately reflected in the market.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>15. Financial and   Tax Reform. </strong>We should establish a democratically regulated and accountable   system of public finance that ensures the protection of taxpayer rights and that   operates through legal procedures. We need a system by which public revenues   that belong to a certain level of government—central, provincial, county or   local—are controlled at that level. We need major tax reform that will abolish   any unfair taxes, simplify the tax system, and spread the tax burden fairly.   Government officials should not be able to raise taxes, or institute new ones,   without public deliberation and the approval of a democratic assembly. We should   reform the ownership system in order to encourage competition among a wider   variety of market participants.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>16. Social Security. </strong>We should   establish a fair and adequate social security system that covers all citizens   and ensures basic access to education, health care, retirement security, and   employment.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>17. Protection of the Environment. </strong>We need to protect   the natural environment and to promote development in a way that is sustainable   and responsible to our descendents and to the rest of humanity. This means   insisting that the state and its officials at all levels not only do what they   must do to achieve these goals, but also accept the supervision and   participation of non-governmental organizations.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>18. A Federated   Republic.</strong> A democratic China should seek to act as a responsible major power   contributing toward peace and development in the Asian Pacific region by   approaching others in a spirit of equality and fairness. In Hong Kong and Macao,   we should support the freedoms that already exist. With respect to Taiwan, we   should declare our commitment to the principles of freedom and democracy and   then, negotiating as equals, and ready to compromise, seek a formula for   peaceful unification. We should approach disputes in the national-minority areas   of China with an open mind, seeking ways to find a workable framework within   which all ethnic and religious groups can flourish. We should aim ultimately at   a federation of democratic communities of China.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>19. Truth in   Reconciliation.</strong> We should restore the reputations of all people, including   their family members, who suffered political stigma in the political campaigns   of the past or who have been labeled as criminals because of their thought,   speech, or faith. The state should pay reparations to these people. All   political prisoners and prisoners of conscience must be released. There should   be a Truth Investigation Commission charged with finding the facts about past   injustices and atrocities, determining responsibility for them, upholding   justice, and, on these bases, seeking social reconciliation.<br/>
        <br/>
        China, as a   major nation of the world, as one of five permanent members of the United   Nations Security Council, and as a member of the UN Council on Human Rights,   should be contributing to peace for humankind and progress toward human rights.   Unfortunately, we stand today as the only country among the major nations that   remains mired in authoritarian politics. Our political system continues to   produce human rights disasters and social crises, thereby not only constricting   China's own development but also limiting the progress of all of human   civilization. This must change, truly it must. The democratization of Chinese   politics can be put off no longer.<br/>
        <br/>
        Accordingly, we dare to put civic   spirit into practice by announcing Charter 08. We hope that our fellow citizens   who feel a similar sense of crisis, responsibility, and mission, whether they   are inside the government or not, and regardless of their social status, will   set aside small differences to embrace the broad goals of this citizens'   movement. Together we can work for major changes in Chinese society and for the   rapid establishment of a free, democratic, and constitutional country. We can   bring to reality the goals and ideals that our people have incessantly been   seeking for more than a hundred years, and can bring a brilliant new chapter to   Chinese civilization.<br/>
