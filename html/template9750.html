中国：著名艺术家、批评人士艾未未遭押，安全堪忧
 
国际笔会严重关注举世闻名的艺术家、著名批评政府人士艾未未自今年4月3日在北京机场被捕后的安全。笔会呼吁立即无条件释放他，以及所有因和平表达自己观点正被关押的人士。笔会寻求紧急保障艾未未的安全，要求立即允许他充分联系家人和法律代理。
 
根据笔会信息，艾未未于今年4月3日在北京国际机场准备登机前往香港参加艺术交流活动时被拘押。随后，警方在当天搜查了他的住所和工作室，传讯了他妻子和八名助手，查抄了一些电脑。他从此下落不明，直到4月7日，官方的新华社报道称，艾未未因涉嫌“经济犯罪”正在接受调查。他的被捕显然是今年2月中旬以来异议人士遭广泛镇压的一部份，在打击对象中包括作家、新闻工作者和维权人士（相关细节参见以前的通报）。艾未未至今仍下落不明，对其安全的关注日渐增大。
 
艾未未现年53岁，是名扬世界的艺术家，是北京奥运会“鸟巢”体育场的共同设计者之一。他也是对中国政府最著名的批评人士之一，在他有很多追随者的推特和博客上，经常就关押异议人士和政府腐败等社会不公发表评论。近年来，艾未未一再遭到骚扰。2009年8月，在曾与之合作调查2008年四川地震的学童死亡人数的异议作家谭作人受审判时，他试图出庭作证而遭成都警察的殴打。同年9月14日，他在德国慕尼黑的医院中被诊断有脑出血，据信与那次警察殴打有关，为此进行了脑部手术。今年1月，他在上海的工作室被当局拆毁。
 
艾未未的第一本书《此时此地》于去年9月由广西师范大学出版社出版。该书是他博客中有关艺术、建筑和评论文章的选集，而他在中国的那些博客自他被关押后已被关闭。该书的未删节全本将在今年晚些时候在香港出版。
 
请发出呼吁：
——抗议著名艺术家和批评人士艾未未被捕，他的被捕显然是近来异议人士遭镇压的一部份，在打击对象中包括作家、新闻工作者和维权人士。
——提醒中国当局遵守《中国宪法》第35条以及其签署的《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》第19条的义务。
——呼吁立即无条件释放艾未未等所有因和平表达自己观点正被关押的人士。
——寻求立即保障艾未未的安全，敦促紧急允许他充分联系家人和法律代理以及任何必要的医疗条件。

CHINA: Prominent artist and critic Ai Weiwei detained; fears for safety.

PEN International is seriously concerned for the welfare of internationally renowned artist and prominent government critic Ai Weiwei following his arrest at Beijing airport on 3 April 2011. PEN calls for his immediate and unconditional release and that of all those currently detained in China for the peaceful expression of their views. It seeks urgent guarantees of the safety of Ai Weiwei and demands that he is given full access to his family and legal representation immediately.
 
According to PEN’s information, Ai Weiwei was detained at Beijing International Airport on 3 April 2011 while preparing to board aflight to Hong Kong, where he had been due to participate in artistic exchange activities. Later that day police raided his home and studio, questioned his wife and eight assistants, and confiscated computers. No news was given about his whereabouts or the reason for his arrest until 7 April 2011, when it was reported by the official Chinese News Agency Xinhua that Ai Weiwei was under investigation for suspected involvement in ‘economic crimes’. His arrest appears to be part of a widespread crackdown on dissent in which writers, journalists and human rights defenders are amongst those to have been targeted since mid-February 2011 (see previous alerts for details). Ai Weiwei’s whereabouts remain unknown and there are mounting concerns for his welfare. 

Ai Weiwei, aged 53, is an internationally recognized artist who co-designed the Olympic Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing. He is one of the most prominent of China's government critics, and has commented frequently on social injustice, including the detentions of fellow dissidents and government corruption, on his widely followed Twitter page and blog. In recent years Ai Weiwei has been repeatedly harassed, and in August 2009 was badly beaten by Chengdu police for attempting to testify in the trial of imprisoned dissident writer Tan Zuren, with whom Ai had worked on an investigation into student casualties of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. On 14 September 2009, Ai was diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage which is believed to be linked to the police attack, and he underwent emergency brain surgery at a hospital in Munich, Germany. In January 2011 his Shanghai studio was destroyed by the authorities. 
 Ai Weiwei's first book, Time and Place, was published by Guangxi Normal University Press in September 2010. The book is a collection of essays on art, architecture and reviews selected from his online publications in his blogs, which have been closed down since his detention. Its complete uncensored version in Chinese will be published in Hong Kong later this year. 
 
Please send appeals:

-          Protesting the arrest of prominent artist and critic Ai Weiwei, whose arrest appears to be part of a recent crackdown on dissent in which writers, journalists and human rights defenders are amongst those targeted;
-          Reminding the Chinese authorities of their obligations under Article 35 of the Chinese constitution and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which it is a signatory;
-          Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all those currently detained in the P.R.China for the peaceful exercise of their right to free expression, including Ai Weiwei.
-          Seeking immediate guarantees of Ai Weiwei’s safety and urging that he is given full access to his family, legal representation and any necessary medical care as a matter of urgency.

Send appeals to:

Please note that there are no fax numbers for the Chinese authorities. WiPC recommends that you copy your appeal to the Chinese embassy in your country asking them to forward it and welcoming any comments.
 
You may find it easier to write to the Chinese ambassador in your own country asking him or her to forward your appeal. Most embassies are obliged to forward such appeals to the relevant officials in the country.  A letter or petition signed by an eminent member of your Centre may give make it more likely for your appeal to be considered. Similarly if your appeal is published in your local press and copied to the Chinese ambassador, this too may have greater impact.
