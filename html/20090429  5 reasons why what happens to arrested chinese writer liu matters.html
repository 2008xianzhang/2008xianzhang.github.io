		<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230926230530/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/23/liu-xiaobo-5-reasons-why_n_190674.html">
		Huffington Post</a></strong><br>
		<br>
		Next week, PEN American Center will award one of its highest honors, the 
		PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award, to Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese 
		intellectual and literary critic who played a pivotal role in Tiananmen 
		Square 20 years ago and who has been in and out of jail ever since for 
		his uncompromising activism for freedom of expression in China.<br>
		<br>
		On December 8, 2008, Liu Xiaobo was arrested again, this time for his 
		involvement in Charter 08, a declaration he co-authored calling for 
		political and human rights reforms in his country. He has since been 
		held under &quot;residential surveillance&quot; at an unknown location and is 
		reportedly being investigated for &quot;inciting subversion of state power.&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		PEN has a special interest in Liu Xiaobo's case: Liu is a PEN member 
		himself, one of 250 members of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, a 
		front-line defender of the freedom to write in China (Liu was President 
		of ICPC from 2003 to 2007 and continues to serve on its Board). But his 
		detention is much more than an internal matter for PEN.<br>
		<br>
		Liu was arrested in that foreign policy dead zone between President 
		Obama's election and his inauguration, when the news was dominated by 
		dire reports about the U.S. economy; China's leaders surely knew they 
		could count on a few months of American indifference. But they must have 
		been as delighted as human rights supporters were shocked when Hillary 
		Clinton, in her first visit as Secretary of State in late February, not 
		only did not publicly protest Liu Xiaobo's detention, but announced that 
		human rights concerns would take a back seat to economic issues in the 
		new administration.<br>
		<br>
		The stance was widely read as a realpolitik acknowledgment of China's 
		status as an emerging world power, a power that has a significant say in 
		the day-to-day realities of other countries, not least the United 
		States.<br>
		<br>
		China is an emerging superpower--which is precisely why the whole world 
		should be so concerned about Liu Xiaobo. Here are 5 reasons why what 
		happens to Liu matters to everyone on the planet:<br>
		<br>
		1) Charter 08 represents a significant and growing movement for 
		political reform in China. The document Liu co-authored is a remarkable 
		attempt both to engage China's leadership and to speak to the Chinese 
		public about where China is and needs to go. It is novel in its breadth 
		and in its list of signers--not only dissidents and human rights 
		lawyers, but also prominent political scientists, economists, writers, 
		artists, grassroots activists, and even government officials. Almost all 
		of the original 300 signers have since been detained or harassed, but 
		more than 8,000 others have now endorsed the document despite the 
		pressure. One of them, a teacher in Yunnan province, recently reported 
		that police contacted her three times asking her to renounce the Charter 
		and proclaim the signer was some other person with the same name. She 
		refused. To stand up for Liu Xiaobo is to stand with a growing number of 
		men and women like her in China.<br>
		<br>
		2) Liu's detention is also an attempt to suppress its own history of 
		violence. This June 4th marks the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen 
		Square crackdown, when the People's Liberation Army overran protesters 
		in and around the square, killing hundreds. Those events remain one of 
		the most taboo subjects in China. Liu is one of several key participants 
		in the 1989 demonstrations who have been detained in advance of the 
		anniversary; most recently, Jiang Qisheng, a writer and current Vice 
		President of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, was interrogated and 
		had his personal computers and notebooks seized. A government that 
		silences those who try to discuss its violent excesses is one that is 
		reserving the power to suppress its people violently in the future. A 
		government that has that power in reserve sooner or later will feel the 
		need to use it.<br>
		<br>
		3) Liu Xiaobo is the kind of figure governments suppress at their peril. 
		A young university professor at the time, Liu was a major protagonist in 
		the final days of the Tiananmen Square protests, and is widely credited 
		with preventing far greater bloodshed when Chinese troops moved into the 
		square. Liu admonished the students to make their own movement more 
		democratic, disarmed a group of workers who appeared with guns to 
		protect the student demonstrators, and helped persuade students to 
		evacuate the square in the final hours. Often abrasive personally but 
		deeply committed to non-violence and democracy, Liu has been able to 
		both articulate and to channel the frustrations of the Chinese people 
		for more than two decades. Stifling such a voice does nothing to address 
		those frustrations, which one way or another will eventually find 
		expression.<br>
		<br>
		4) Liu's arrest shows what happens when the world fails to challenge 
		China on its human rights abuses. In its bid to host the 2008 Beijing 
		Olympics, China pledged to improve its human rights record and ensure 
		Internet and press freedom before and during the Olympics. It did 
		neither. Thirteen writers, journalists, and bloggers were jailed during 
		the year, including 2 of Liu's colleagues at the Independent Chinese PEN 
		Center. The world did little to protest these arrests, and now that the 
		international spotlight has moved elsewhere, Chinese authorities clearly 
		believe they can move against figures like Liu. Secretary Clinton's 
		comments during her visit to Beijing in February only served to fortify 
		this notion.<br>
		<br>
		5) If China can jail Liu Xiaobo without repercussions, dissident voices 
		around the world are even more vulnerable. A feature of China's 
		ascendancy on the world stage has been its implicit agreement with 
		rights-abusing regimes that it will turn a blind eye to even the most 
		blatant human rights violations in exchange for preferred commercial 
		relations. The courageous men and women who are challenging tyranny in 
		these countries are looking to the United States and Europe for 
		assurances that their fate, and the fate of their countries, depends on 
		something more than the bottom line. To fail to challenge the Chinese 
		government on Liu Xiaobo's imprisonment is to concede this argument 
		internationally, at enormous peril to peaceful advocates of progress and 
		change around the world.<br>
