如果被判有罪，陈克贵将面临至少10年监禁，甚至是死刑。在当局对他叔叔陈光诚的搜捕过程中，陈克贵挥舞着切肉刀对抗闯入他家中的人。
 
陈克贵的律师说陈克贵属于正当防卫，他只是伤到了闯入者，陈克贵的法律团队已经受到来自地方当局的强大压力，要求他们不要插手这个中国近年来最政治化的刑事案件。
 
陈克贵的律师刘卫国说他已经从陈的家人那里听到了这个起诉。当局警告他不能与外媒谈及更多。
 
另外的一个为陈克贵提供辩护的律师，陈武权对卫报说他本应该在周四去山东与他的当事人会面，但是他的律师执照已经被没收。
 
尽管存在着风险，另外有一些中国人权律师承诺要插手此案。在去年的一个针对律师的打压过程中，有几个律师曾被拘留，审问，甚至严刑拷打。 
 
正在北京医院接受恢复治疗的陈光诚正在等待去美国的证件，陈光诚说，他对家人遭到的“疯狂报复”感到很厌恶。
 
“我听说我的大哥被禁止离开村子。我的侄子被拘留。我的嫂子在交了保释金后被释放。我大哥家中的所有电话都被拿走，”陈光诚在接受卫报电话采访时说。
 
“我感觉糟透了。那些当地政府派来的人跟土匪没什么两样……在山东发生的事应该被彻底调查。一个当地的官员对我说，他们有他们的手段，他们不信任中央政府。”
 
他说一位信访局的官员已经向他承诺要调查在山东发生的事。尽管在信访局，查到官员们的有过失的机率还不到1%，但陈光诚说他会“等待并期待”正义的到来。
 
陈光诚自己离真正自由还有很长一段路。尽管他受中美之间的一个协议所保护，自从上周末他就没能再看到美国政府官员。卫报在内的试图探望他的记者们，已经被威胁，有的记者采访身份已被当局暂时没收。
 
陈光诚说他的活动范围被限制。“当我告诉他们我要到外面晒太阳，呼吸一下新鲜空气时，他们拒绝了我的要求。所以我只能一直呆在病房里，”陈光诚说。他的妻子与孩子也需要许可才能出去。“外面的人不让进来，尤其是记者和我的朋友。只有被当局批准人的才能来探望我。”
 
中国政府上周说与其他中国公民一样，陈光诚可以自由申请出国，但是到现在中国当局也没有处理陈光诚的护照申请。

Chen Guangcheng's nephew charged with voluntary manslaughter

Chen Kegui arrested over clash with intruders at his home during search for his activist uncle

The nephew of the Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng has been charged with voluntary manslaughter, amid growing concerns about reprisals and intimidation of lawyers.

The arrest comes as a senior lawyer defending Chen described to the Guardian how he lost his hearing in a beating by a senior state security official after he tried to visit his client in hospital last week.

Chen - a self-trained "barefoot lawyer" – has risen to international prominence since his intrepid escape last month from extrajudicial house arrest cast a harsh light on China's repressive domestic security policies and triggered a flurry of bilateral diplomacy.

But while he is now confident of his own safety, fears are growing about his family and lawyers.

The activist's nephew Chen Kegui faces a sentence ranging from 10 years in prison to the death penalty after he brandished a meat cleaver at intruders who burst into his home in Linyi, Shandong province, during the search for his uncle.

Lawyers say he acted in self-defence and only wounded the intruders, but his legal team have come under intense pressure from the local authorities to drop what looks set to become one of China's most politicised criminal cases in recent years.

Liu Weiguo, his lawyer, said he had heard about the charges from the Chen family. He said it was difficult to talk further because the authorities had forbidden him from talking to the foreign media.

Another member of the defence team, Chen Wuquan (no relation), told the Guardian he was supposed to visit Shandong on Thursday to meet his client, but his lawyer's licence had been confiscated.

Jiang Tianyong, another lawyer, said the charges were ridiculous.

"Obviously it was justifiable self-defence. What else can you call it when 10 armed, unknown men crawl over the wall, break into his house and beat him? Instead of punishing the culprits, the authorities are reversing the meaning of 'good' and 'evil'."

Jiang named several other lawyers under house arrest or close surveillance: Xu Zhiyong, Li Heping, Li Fangping, Teng Biao, and Li Xiongbing.

"Lawyers are forced not to be lawyers. Things like this only happen in China," said Jiang, whose eardrum was perforated during a beating by the head of state security last week after he tried to visit Chen in hospital.

Speaking by telephone, Jiang said he was abducted by 10 people when he tried to visit Chen on 3 May at the Beijing hospital where the activist is being treated. The lawyer was taken to a hotel on Linglong street, close to the Enjizhuang police station that is notorious for extra-legal interrogations. He said the head of Haidian district's state security, Du Yuhui, was responsible.

"Du Yuhui beat me only three times, once on my left ear, once on my right ear and once on my chest. It was only three times, but it was very very heavy. I still can't hear things clearly."

Other lawyers committed to the protection of rights in China have offered to step in and represent Chen Kegui, despite the risk of repercussions. Several of them were detained, interrogated and in some cases tortured last year in a separate crackdown.

Chen Guangcheng, who is now recuperating in a Beijing hospital and waiting for permission to travel to the US, said he was disgusted by the "mad retribution" against his relatives since he escaped from extralegal house arrest.

"I heard my older brother is not allowed to leave the village. My nephew is in police custody. My sister-in-law has been released on bail. All of the phones and mobile phones in my older brother's family have been taken away," he said by telephone.

"I feel awful about this. The people sent by the local government are like gangsters … What happened in Shandong should be thoroughly investigated. One local cadre even told me that they have their own ways to administer the district and they don't believe in the central government."

He said a cadre from the letters and visits bureau had promised an investigation into the events in Shandong. The bureau has a less than 1% record of finding officials guilty, but Chen said he would "wait and hope" for justice.

He too is far from at liberty. Although he is partly protected by a high-level deal between the Chinese and US governments, he has not been able to see US officials since the weekend. Journalists who have tried to visit him, including from the Guardian, have been threatened or had their press credentials temporarily confiscated.

Chen said his movements were restricted. "When I told them I needed to go outside to get some sunshine and fresh air, they refused. So I have to stay in my ward all the time," he said. His wife and children also need permission to go out. "Outside visitors are not allowed yet, especially reporters or my friends. Only approved people have been permitted to visit me."

The Chinese government said last week that Chen was free to apply for overseas travel like any other citizen, but it has yet to process his request for a passport.
