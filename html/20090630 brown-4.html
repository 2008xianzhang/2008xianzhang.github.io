            <br/>
            刘晓波被中国政府正式逮捕，太平洋彼岸南半球澳大利亚绿党领袖布朗参议员即刻在参议院向澳洲政府提出质问，要求澳洲向中国政府施加政治压力。下面是2009年6月25日下午澳洲国会参议院布朗参议员与政府参议院领袖国防部长福克纳参议员之间的参议院问答原文。当天下午澳洲参议院还就布朗参议员的动议进行了表决。英文原文下附。<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            澳大利亚参议员布朗就刘晓波向政府提问<br/>
            <br/>
            2009年6月25日星期四，参议院第55会议厅<br/>
            中国：人权<br/>
            <br/>
            布朗参议员（下午2：19）：<br/>
            我的提问，几乎没有预先通知，是对代表外交部的部长提出的。问题关于著名中国民主人士、08宪章的起草人之一刘晓波的状况，他为中国的自由、民权和个人尊严而鼓与呼。刘晓波半年前被捕，直到现在才被正式逮捕并被指控企图散布流言、蓄意颠覆国家政权和社会主义制度的罪行。我要问我们的政府是否支持刘晓波和中国的民主事业？关于这么一位极具勇气的中国民主化推动者所遭遇的困苦我们的政府做了什么，而且这位伟大而又高尚的勇者所遭遇的困境今天参议院可以获得什么样的信息？<br/>
            <br/>
            福克纳参议员：<br/>
            感谢布朗参议员提出这个问题。我当然可以通过议长先生对布朗参议员这么说：我，当然还有政府，都知道并且得到证实中国已经以颠覆罪逮捕了举世著名的作家刘晓波。我还可以明确地报告参议院：澳大利亚将再次敦促中方释放刘晓波。澳大利亚政府敦促中国正视08宪章签署人的要求。我还可以向参议院，尤其是布朗参议员，保证政府会继续就中国拘押08宪章签名人以及其他行使国际公认的自由权利（包括言论自由）的人士表示表示我们的立场。<br/>
            <br/>
            澳大利亚将继续就人权问题与中国进行坦率的接触，包括两国高层领导人之间的澳中人权对话。我还要说，我想我已经说过，我们相信鼓励中国在人权问题上更加进步的最好方法就是通过这些渠道，而且政府鼓励这样的建议。（发言时间到）<br/>
            <br/>
            布朗参议员：<br/>
            议长先生，我想补充一个问题。请问福克纳参议员：澳中是在哪个层面上进行联系的？我们的总理是否已经抓起电话致电中国总理并用普通话询问刘晓波所遭受的苦楚？如果没有，是否他会致电？如果没有，那是哪个层面的接触？是否仅仅是官员对官员的层级的接触，诚如我们经常看到澳大利亚政府作为？最后我要请问：为什么政府不支持绿党在两周前，也是在这个地方，提出的谴责中方逮捕和拘押刘晓波的动议？难道会不是政府认为这是对正在起诉刘晓波的北京当局的某种宽慰吧？<br/>
             <br/>
            <br/>
            福克纳参议员：<br/>
            布朗参议员，我无法确切地回答你的问题，是何种层面的接触。我只能为你在这一点上思索一些建议。我当然可以比较笼统地告诉你，并希望这对你有用。澳洲政府经常直接地向中国领导人提出中国人权问题。比如据我所知，外长在今年三月访问中国时就人权问题向中国外长杨洁篪表达了澳洲政府的看法；我知道外长在2008年二月和七月向中国外长提出同样的问题；而且我知道总理在今年四月以及去年四月和八月与中国领导人会谈时提出关于中国人权的看法。（时间到）<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            布朗参议员：<br/>
            议长先生，我还想补充一个问题。许多澳洲人因为政府呼吁谴责当前伊朗政府压制民主的行为而对政府表示赞赏。我想通过议长先生询问部长先生：政府是否会考虑召回澳洲驻中国大使，寻求中国政府的解释并且表达澳洲在刘晓波被捕一事态度？<br/>
            <br/>
            福克纳参议员：<br/>
            我认为我已经代表政府表明了强烈关注。我需要帮布朗参议员查看一下政府就他所提出的特别问题的直接计划。但我可以向你保证，政府和外交部会持续在人权问题方面向堪培拉和北京的双方外交使节提出关注。布朗参议员，我需要就你所提出的问题寻找更进一步的建议。而且如果我能够在近期得到一些信息，我很乐意尽可能早地提供给你。<br/>
            <br/>
            中国：人权<br/>
            <br/>
            福克纳参议员（新州——国防部长）（下午3：04）：<br/>
            我想就布朗参议员今天的提问时间向我提出的补充问题的要点进行回应。<br/>
            我从外交与贸易部得到一些建议。我记得布朗参议员曾问过我对于逮捕刘晓波一事何种层级所做的交涉。我可以向布朗参议员说明，这些交涉是通过澳洲驻华大使馆向中国外交部提出的，首先是参赞何一秘层级，后来又在多个场合仍然是参赞和一秘的层级。我还被知会，就回应布朗参议员提出的关于召回驻华大使，目前的答案是“没有”。政府认为在这个问题上最合适渠道通过外交途经，直接向中国当局表达我们的关注。<br/>
            <br/>
            我希望在我的答复中回应布朗参议员提出的另一个关于先前参议院决议的问题，但没有充足的时间。如果我有足够时间的话，我希望向参议院说明：我曾经在很多场合，或许有些人认为是太多场合，对于参议院处理有关外交事务的动议的方式做过评论——它们是迟钝的工具。我确实希望强调的事实是政府非常乐意在为这类动议与所有党派合作，尤其是小党。<br/>
            <br/>
            我知道布朗参议员和其他澳洲绿党参议员都提出过很多提议。但是，正如我现在一直坚持的，不论是在野还是执政，政府认为，这些是迟钝的工具，而且对某项提议只有机会投票赞成或反对对票，政府只能在可以完全支持某个动议的前提下投赞成票。换句话说，政府认为如果想让动议被通过，则必须让其内容完全被政府赞成。<br/>
            我知道布朗参议员清楚这点，但他就这个问题提出了一另一议题。那么我站在我的立场，我不希望回避或搁置这个话题，再说我已经寻求过关于他提出的这个问题某些要点。此外，这是绿党提交给参议院的动议并且进行表决：<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            布朗参议员（塔斯马尼亚——澳大利亚绿党领袖）（下午3：50）：我动议：参议院应当：<br/>
             <br/>
             (1)不忘20年前的1989年6月4日在天安门广场遭到屠杀的成千上万的民众；<br/>
            <br/>
               (2)支持中国知名学者与活动家起草的08宪章中提出的民主与人权原则；<br/>
            <br/>
               (3)谴责中国政府对于08宪章签署人的拘押和审问，包括继续拘押起草人刘晓波。<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            下午3:59参议院投票揭晓，6票赞成，31票反对，动议被否决。 <br/>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            Thursday, 25 June 2009 SENATE 55   CHAMBER<br/>
            China: Human Rights<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator BOB BROWN (2.19 pm)—My   question, with almost no notice, is to the Minister representing the Minister   for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the plight of the famed Chinese democrat Liu   Xiaobo, who is coauthor of the Charter 08 declaration, which calls for freedom,   civil rights and human decency in China. He has been under arrest for six months   and has now been formally arrested and charged with trying to spread rumours,   subversion of the state and overthrowing the socialist system. I ask the   government: will it make a stand for Liu Xiaobo and democracy in China? What   representations have been made to the government about the plight of this   extraordinarily courageous advocate for democracy in China and what news can be   given to the Senate about the plight of this great and noble   person?<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator FAULKNER—I thank Senator Brown for his question.   Certainly I can say to Senator Brown— through you, Mr President—that I am aware,   as is the government of course, of the reports that China has now confirmed the   arrest of the internationally acclaimed author Liu Xiaobo on grounds of   subversion. I can certainly say to the Senate that Australia again calls for his   release. The Australian government encourages China to address the concerns   raised by the authors of Charter 08. I can also assure the Senate, and Senator   Brown particularly, that the government will continue to make representations to   China on the detention of Charter 08 signatories and others who were exercising   internationally recognised liberties including freedom of   speech.<br/>
            <br/>
            Australia will continue to engage frankly with China on   questions of human rights, including higher level meetings through the   Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. I say also, as I think I have said   before, that we believe the best way to encourage China to make further progress   on human rights issues is through those channels, and the government has   encouraged that as opposed to—(Time expired)<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator BOB BROWN—Mr   President, I ask a supplementary question. I ask Senator Faulkner at what level   the contact has been made with China. Has, indeed, the Prime Minister rung his   counterpart in China and spoken in Mandarin about the plight of Liu Xiaobo? If   not, will he? If not, at what level is the contact? Is it simply going to be at   official-to-official level, as we have so often seen with Australian   governments, that this contact will be made? Finally, I ask: why did the   government not support the Greens’ motion in this place two weeks ago condemning   Liu Xiaobo’s arrest and detention? Does the government not think that was some   sort of comfort to the Beijing authorities, who now have him up on these   charges?<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator FAULKNER—Senator Brown, I am unable specifically   to answer your question that goes to the level of contact. I can only seek some   advice on that for you. I certainly can say more generally to you—and I hope   this assists you—that the Australian government regularly raises its concerns on   human rights and does so directly with China’s leaders. I know that, for   example, the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised our human rights concerns with   Foreign Minister<br/>
            Yang Jiechi in March this year during the Australian   foreign minister’s visit to Beijing; I know he raised those concerns with Mr   Yang in February and July 2008; and I know the Prime Minister raised human   rights concerns in his meetings with Chinese leaders in April this year and in   April and August of last year.<br/>
            (Time expired)<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator BOB   BROWN—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Many Australians   will laud the Australian government for having called in the representative of   Iran over the current actions in that country in repressing democracy. I ask the   minister— through you, Chair—whether the government will consider calling in the   ambassador from China to seek an explanation and to express Australia’s position   on the arrest of Liu Xiaobo and the obviously fraught position that this great   man now faces in China.<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator FAULKNER—I think I have indicated   a strong statement of concern on behalf of the government.<br/>
            I will need to   check for Senator Brown what the immediate plans are in relation to the specific   question that he raises, but I can assure you that the government and the   Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to raise concerns about human   rights issues with representatives in Canberra and Beijing. I will need to seek   some further advice for you, Senator Brown, on the specific issue you have   raised and, if I am able to get some information soon, I am very happy to   certainly provide it to you at the earliest available   opportunity.<br/>
            <br/>
            China: Human Rights<br/>
            Senator FAULKNER (New   South Wales—Minister for Defence) (3.04 pm)—I want to respond to some elements   of the supplementary questions that Senator Bob Brown asked me in question time   today.<br/>
            <br/>
            I have sought some advice from the Department of Foreign   Affairs and Trade. It may be recalled that Senator Brown asked me at what level   representations were made regarding the arrest of Liu Xiaobo. I can indicate to   Senator Brown that these were made through our Beijing embassy to the Chinese   Ministry of Foreign Affairs, initially at councillor and first secretary level,   and subsequently followed up on several occasions at councillor and first   secretary level.<br/>
            <br/>
            I have also been advised, in response to the   question raised by Senator Brown in relation to calling in the Chinese   ambassador, that the answer at this stage is no. The government considers the   most appropriate avenue on this occasion will be through diplomatic channels in   China, registering our concerns directly with the Chinese authorities in   Beijing.<br/>
            <br/>
            I had intended also in my answer, but did not have   enough time available to me, to address another issue that Senator Brown raised,   which went to the question of a previous resolution of the   Senate.<br/>
            <br/>
            I was going to indicate to the Senate, if I had had   enough time, that I have made on very many occasions, perhaps some would say on   far too many occasions, some comments about how foreign affairs motions are   dealt with in the Senate—that they are blunt instruments. I do want to reinforce   the fact that the government is very happy to work with all parties,   particularly minor parties, on notices of motion of this   nature.<br/>
            <br/>
            I know that Senator Brown and others in the Australian   Greens move a lot of notices of motion. But, as I have said consistently now,   both in opposition and in government, the government takes the view that,   because they are such blunt instruments and there is an opportunity only to vote   either in favour of them or against them, the government can only support a   motion which it supports in its entirety. In other words, the government takes   the view that it needs to be completely satisfied with the content of any   motion.<br/>
            <br/>
            I know Senator Brown is aware of this, but it was another   issue that he raised in his question and, now that I am on my feet, I did not   want to leave that issue unanswered or in abeyance, given that I sought some   immediate advice on those other elements of the question he asked. Also, this   was the motion that the Greens put to the Senate and the resulting   vote:<br/>
            <br/>
            Senator BOB BROWN (Tasmania) (Leader of the Australian   Greens) (3:50 PM) —I move: That the Senate—<br/>
            <br/>
            (a) remembers the   thousands of people who were killed 20 years ago on 4 June 1989 in the Tiananmen   Square massacre; <br/>
            <br/>
            (b)supports the pro-democracy and pro-human   rights principles outlined in Charter 08, which has been written by prominent   Chinese academics and activists; and <br/>
            <br/>
            (c)condemns the detention   and interrogation of signatories to the Charter 08 by Chinese authorities,   including the continued detention of acclaimed author Liu   Xiaobo.<br/>
            <br/>
