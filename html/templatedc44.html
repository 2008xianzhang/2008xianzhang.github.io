我们在下签署的笔会，深切关注澳大利亚公民、作家杨恒均持续遭受到的不公正待遇。在杨恒均经过两年多审前羁押并遭受酷刑及其他形式的虐待后，2021 年 5 月 27 日其庭审进行了数小时闭门听证，引起了有关公平审判权和司法透明原则的重大疑问。据悉，此后法院一再延期，原定于2022年1月9日宣判，又第三次推迟，更加剧了杨恒均受到的不公正待遇。我们还收到报告，他的身体状况严重恶化，尽管其肾功能衰竭的风险增加，但他却没有得到充分的治疗。

鉴于有关杨恒均审判的严重程序问题以及对他毫无根据的指控，我们呼吁中华人民共和国政府结束此案的不公正，为杨恒均立即无条件释放提供便利，让他接受医疗并安全重返澳大利亚。

杨恒均是澳大利亚小说家、学者和政论家，致力于促进中国人权和更大自由。他的系列间谍小说《致命三部曲》，聚焦于为美国和中国两政府情报机关工作的双重间谍的虚构冒险。据报道，该系列在中国遭禁，但在互联网上的中国侨民中广泛传播。

杨恒均的博文在中文社交媒体上获得大量关注，其数十篇文章后被译成英文并发表于《外交官》（The Diplomat）。其作品的普遍主题是民主价值的长处，中美间更大了解的需要，以及他对专制统治问题的个人醒悟，在其追随者中赢得“民主小贩”的外号。 据报道，2019 年 1 月，杨恒均与妻儿从美国飞往中国，此后被中国政府安全部门拘留。他最初以被称为“指定居所监视居住”的恶名昭彰法外拘留形式，关押在某秘密地点六个月，据报曾遭受酷刑。 2019 年 8 月，杨恒均以涉嫌从事间谍活动被正式逮捕，但并未披露任何支持指控的证据给其家人或领事代表。

杨恒均在长达两年多的审前羁押期间，被拒绝家人探视，获律师和领事探视的机会也有限。据报道，他遭受了 300 多次审讯，他有关撤销屈打成招供词的请求被中国政府拒绝。 2021 年 5 月 27 日，杨恒均案庭审讯闭门进行，据报持续了不到七小时，其领事代表被拒绝到庭旁听，因此违反了《维也纳公约》和澳中双边领事协定。

开庭前，杨恒均在被羁押期间转述的信件中，表示希望自己能够继续写作，以“帮助中国了解世界”。他在考虑审判的潜在结果时说：

“我们以及我和我的读者所共享的价值观和信仰比我个人大多了。如果有人因为我的写作要报复我，那就请向中国国内的人民解释我到底做了什么，解释我的写作对中国人民的意义。”

我们在下签署的笔会，呼吁中国政府立即无条件释放杨恒均，让他及其家人得以安全返回澳大利亚自由生活，无须担心进一步迫害。

China: PEN Centres world-wide call for the release of Australian writer Yang Hengjun


We, the undersigned PEN Centres, are deeply concerned about the ongoing unjust treatment of writer and Australian citizen, Yang Hengjun. After over two years of pre-trial detention where he was subjected to torture and other forms of ill treatment, on 27 May 2021 Yang Hengjun’s trial took place over the course of a few hours in a closed hearing, raising significant questions concerning Yang Hengjun’s right to a fair trial and the principle of judicial transparency. After repeated delays, the court’s judgement was due to be made public on 9 January 2022, however we have since received information that the verdict has been delayed for a third time, compounding the injustice that Yang has been subjected to. We have also received reports that his physical condition has seriously deteriorated, and that he has received inadequate medical treatment despite being at increased risk of kidney failure.

In light of the serious procedural issues surrounding his trial and the unsubstantiated allegations made against him, we call on the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to end this injustice and facilitate Yang Hengjun’s immediate and unconditional release so that he can receive medical treatment and be safely repatriated to Australia.

Yang Hengjun is an Australian novelist, scholar and political commentator who is committed to the advancement of human rights and greater freedoms in China. His trilogy of spy novels, known as the Fatal Weakness series, is centred on the fictional escapades of a double agent working for both the US and PRC government intelligence agencies. The series is reportedly banned in the PRC but has been shared widely online among Chinese diasporas.

His blog posts have garnered a significant following on Chinese social media, and dozens of his articles were later translated into English and published on The Diplomat. Common themes in his writing are the virtues of democratic values, the need for greater understanding between China and the United States, and his personal awakening to the problematic aspects of autocratic rule, earning him the nickname ‘Democracy Peddler’ among his followers.

In January 2019, Yang reportedly flew with his wife and child from the United States to China where he was then detained by the PRC government’s security services. He was initially held at a secret location for six months in a notorious form of extrajudicial detention called Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location, where Yang was reportedly tortured. In August 2019 Yang was formally arrested on suspicion of espionage without any evidence supporting the charge disclosed to his family or consular representatives.

Throughout his over two years of pre-trial detention, Yang was denied family visits and was granted limited access to legal counsel and consular visits. He was reportedly subjected to over 300 interrogations and his request for the dismissal of testimony he gave under torture was denied by the PRC government.
On 27 May 2021, Yang’s trial was held behind closed doors and reportedly lasted less than seven hours, with his consular representatives denied the ability to attend, a breach of both the Vienna Convention and the Australia-China bilateral consular agreement.

Prior to the commencement of his trial, Yang Hengjun shared his hope that he would be able to continue writing ‘to help China to understand the world’ in a message he had transcribed while detained. When considering the trial’s potential outcome, Yang Hengjun said:

‘If worse comes to worst, if someone wants to take revenge on me for my writings, please explain to the people inside China what I did, and the significance of my writing to people in China. The values and beliefs which we shared, and which I shared with my readers, are something bigger than myself.’

We, the undersigned PEN Centres, call on the PRC government to immediately and unconditionally release Yang Hengjun so that he and his family can be safely repatriated to Australia to live freely without fear of further persecution.
