      <p>Official Chinese media announced Wednesday that Liu Xiaobo, one of China's   most prominent intellectuals, had been formally arrested on suspicion of   &quot;inciting subversion of state power&quot; following a six-month detention. The   eventual decision to arrest and charge him does not come as a surprise: It only   confirms that the Chinese leadership is becoming more paranoid in its handling   of dissent at a time of intensifying social, political and moral crisis.</p>
      <p>Mr. Liu first became famous for his activism during the Tiananmen Square   protests of 1989, but his recent arrest reveals a lot about the state of   political change in China today. Based on the facts publicly available, Mr.   Liu's only &quot;crime&quot; appears to be that he exercised his constitutional right to   free speech in a political system still unable genuinely to tolerate dissent.   Mr. Liu was a co-author of Charter 08, a clear, bold and persuasively worded   call for political and legal liberalization, and he was detained just two days   before the document's release last December. The &quot;subversion&quot; crime with which   he has now been charged makes a mockery of the civil rights -- including freedom   of speech -- that the Chinese Constitution professes to safeguard. These rights   often contradict the principles of Party Rule and lack effective protection in   China.</p>
      <p>In 2004, a commitment to protecting human rights was written into the Chinese   Constitution. At that time some still hoped China might be on the way to a more   liberal system through gradual, top-down legal reforms. But in the following   years, the prospects of further liberalization of the system closed down. It was   as though the party-state had come to realize how untenable its current hold on   power would be under genuine rule of law. As cases of rights violations and   government corruption accumulated in the midst of economic boom, the leadership   decided to change its approach to these problems, from better protecting citizen   rights to more comprehensive authoritarian repression. Courts have been reminded   that they must serve &quot;the Party's cause&quot; and &quot;social stability.&quot; Human-rights   lawyers have been obstructed, harassed, subjected to cruelty and disbarred.   Petitioners have been beaten, detained and even put in psychiatric   institutions.</p>
      <p>Yet the voices of dissatisfied citizens have grown stronger and louder: The   Internet is burgeoning with citizen-journalists uncovering new cases of   corruption and official venality. More streets and fields have become scenes of   labor and land-rights protests as more citizens have taken the freedom at least   to demand justice.</p>
      <p>It was a sense of growing crisis, of &quot;now or never,&quot; that led to the   production of Charter 08, which was modeled on the Czechoslovakian Charter 77.   &quot;This is a historic moment for China,&quot; the drafters wrote. &quot;The decline of the   existing system has reached the point where change is no longer optional.&quot;   Charter 08 appealed to many citizens. One of the thousands of Chinese signers,   understanding full well that she could face severe consequences, wrote that she   signed it &quot;after a good cry.&quot;</p>
      <p>By formally arresting Mr. Liu, the authorities have set another sign of   assertive return to an authoritarian political model that emphasizes Chinese   characteristics and leaves no room for &quot;universal values.&quot; Mr. Liu is almost   certain to join the ranks of dissidents previously convicted of &quot;inciting   subversion,&quot; among them, the disappeared human-rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and   the imprisoned activist Hu Jia. What could now save Mr. Liu from an unjust   conviction and prison sentence would be a political, not a judicial, decision.   But the party-state has yet to understand the full power of the ideas it is so   anxious to suppress.</p>
