									One of the world¡¯s most prestigious literary 
									awards will be bestowed today on Liu Xiaobo, 
									the Chinese dissident and writer. But the 
									man himself will spend the day in a 
									windowless cell, unaware of the honour.
									<p>The 54-year-old writer has been in 
									detention since December 8, when police took 
									him from his home for questioning for his 
									role as author of the Charter 08 appeal, 
									made public on the same day, which calls for 
									freedom of speech and democratic reforms in 
									China. </p>
									<p>Mr Liu is to receive the 2009 PEN/Barbara 
									Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award. </p>

									Kwame Anthony Appiah, president of the PEN 
									American Centre, said: ¡°The liberties that 
									allow all of us to make meaningful lives 
									have always depended, alas, on those who are 
									willing, like Liu Xiaobo, to put their own 
									freedom at risk. His consistent 
									self-sacrifice for the cause of democracy in 
									China should inspire all freedom¡¯s friends 
									around the world. I am filled with 
									admiration ¨C indeed, with awe ¨C each time I 
									read about the extraordinary things he has 
									done.¡±
									<p>Mr Liu's wife, Liu Xia, told <i>The Times</i>: 
									¡°I miss him. I just want him to come home.&quot; 
									Ms Liu, an artist with no interest in 
									politics, sits in an apartment whose walls 
									are decorated with black and white 
									photographic portraits of her husband. She 
									has seen him only twice since police raided 
									the apartment, taking away her husband along 
									with papers, mobile phones and his 
									computers. </p>
									<p>He is being held at an unknown location 
									under a form of house arrest that allows the 
									police to detain him for up to six months, 
									although his detention may be extended. He 
									has not been allowed access to a lawyer. </p>
									<p>Ms Liu has been taken to meet him, also 
									at an undisclosed location, once on New 
									Year¡¯s Day and once last month. She said 
									that he appeared to be in better spirits on 
									her second visit. Asked if she feared that 
									her husband could be formally arrested and 
									charged with a crime, Ms Liu said: ¡°We are 
									both prepared for the worst. </p>
									<p>¡°I just want him to be treated in 
									accordance with the law. The authorities 
									must respect the law. And I would like him 
									to see sunlight.¡± </p>
									<p>Mr Liu¡¯s only glimpse of daylight came 
									from a skylight in his bathroom that 
									adjoined the room where he was being held in 
									solitary confinement, she said. He had not 
									been allowed outside for exercise. She took 
									him about 80 books as well as notebooks and 
									pens, but about 30 of the books were 
									returned to her along with pens and paper; 
									police told her that he was not allowed to 
									write. </p>
									<p>¡°It seemed to me that they were mainly 
									allowing him only to read novels. But he 
									does now have a television and he has always 
									enjoyed watching sport.¡± </p>
									<p>Mr Liu, an academic who came to 
									prominence in the mid-1980s as a literary 
									critic, is no stranger to China's prisons. 
									He has been arrested repeatedly since he 
									spent 20 months in detention after the 1989 
									student-led protests that ended with the 
									June 4 Tiananmen Square confrontation. He 
									was jailed for three years in the 1990s but 
									remains among the most outspoken critics of 
									the system. </p>
									<p>He was among the 303 initial signatories 
									of Charter 08, a manifesto consciously 
									modelled on the Charter 77 drawn up by 
									Vaclav Havel in the former Czechoslovakia, 
									but is the only one to have been detained. 
									Several thousand people have added their 
									names to the charter since he was arrested.
									</p>
									<p>Friends fear Mr Liu will remain in 
									detention past the anniversary of Tiananmen 
									and, possibly, the celebrations on October 1 
									of the 60th anniversary of the founding of 
									the People¡¯s Republic. </p>
									<p>Ms Liu said: ¡°Xiaobo had thought he might 
									be taken in for the anniversary of June 4 
									but he didn¡¯t think that Charter 08 would 
									cause his arrest.¡± She issued an appeal last 
									week in <i>The Washington Post</i> asking 
									President Barack Obama to raise his case.
