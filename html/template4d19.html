中国：著名艺术家艾未未面临巨额罚金

6月28日，据报政府税务官员造访了于一周前取保候审获释的举世关注艺术家艾未未，要求他补缴税款及罚金共计1,200多万元人民币。艾的海内外支持者们认为征收巨额罚金是为报复他批评政府。艾未未曾于今年4月初因不具体的“经济犯罪”被捕。国际笔会将继续追踪艾未未案，并严重关注其对外联系的权利继续受限，仍然对中国言论自由的普遍严峻状况感到震惊。

艾未未于今年4月3日因不明确的“经济犯罪”被拘捕。他的被捕引发中国国内外的广泛谴责，包括各国政府、艺术界与人权界知名人士。他于6 月 22日以取保候审获释。在被关押期间他被禁见家人和律师，引起外界担心他的人身安全。他获释后拒绝回答问题，只说他不能接受记者采访或使用推特等网络社交媒体。他也被禁止离开北京。

6月28日，美联社报道说，税务局官员前一天到他家，递交他一份通知书，据信涉及一份约500万元未交税款的帐单和约700万元罚金，涉及过去10年。据说艾拒绝在那通知书上签名。报道引他母亲的话说，在过去10年里没人通知有这类缴税要求。艾的支持者们称他因批评中国政府受到报复。更多信息参见：
http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/jun/28/ai-weiwei-tax-bill-china?INTCMP=SRCH


背景资料

艾未未于今年4月3日在北京国际机场准备登机前往香港参加艺术交流活动时被拘押。随后，警方在当天搜查了他的住所和工作室，传讯了他妻子和八名助手，查抄了一些电脑。他从此下落不明，直到4月7日，官方的新华社报道称，艾未未因涉嫌“经济犯罪”正在接受调查。他的被捕显然是今年2月中旬以来异议人士遭广泛镇压的一部份，在打击对象中包括作家、新闻工作者和维权人士（相关细节参见以前的通报）。

艾未未现年53岁，是名扬世界的艺术家，是北京奥运会“鸟巢”体育场的共同设计者之一。他也是对中国政府最著名的批评人士之一，在他有很多追随者的推特和博客上，经常就关押异议人士和政府腐败等社会不公发表评论。近年来，艾未未一再遭到骚扰。2009年8月，在曾与之合作调查2008年四川地震的学童死亡人数的异议作家谭作人受审判时，他试图出庭作证而遭成都警察的殴打。同年9月14日，他在德国慕尼黑的医院中被诊断有脑出血，据信与那次警察殴打有关，为此进行了脑部手术。今年1月，他在上海的工作室被当局拆毁。

艾未未的第一本书《此时此地》于去年9月由广西师范大学出版社出版。该书是他博客中有关艺术、建筑和评论文章的选集，而他在中国的那些博客自他被关押后已被关闭。该书的未删节全本将在今年晚些时候在香港出版。

请发出呼吁：

——表示欢迎艾未未取保候审获释，同时表达关注他仍受到限制、包括拒绝他言论自由的权利；

——寻求确保对他逃税的指控并非用以报复他对政府的批评，关注这种中国国内外普遍的担忧；

——提醒中国有关当局尊重《宪法》第35条和早已签署的联合国《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》第19条，寻求确保这些国际承诺得以遵守；

——呼吁立即无条件释放中国违背已签署的联合国《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》第19条保障的自由表达权利所关押的全部人士。

RAN 16/11 update

CHINA: Artist Ai Weiwei faces enormous fines


On 28 June 2011, it was reported that Ai Weiwei, the internationally acclaimed artist who had been freed on bail a week earlier, had been visited by government tax officials with a demand for over 12 m yuan (c. 1.3 m Euro) in unpaid taxes and fines. Ai’s supporters in China and abroad believe that these heavy fines have been levied in retaliation for his criticism of the government. Ai Weiwei had been arrested in early April 2011 on for unspecified "economic crimes". PEN International continues to monitor Ai Weiwei’s case, and has serious concerns about the continuing restrictions on his right to communicate with others. It also remains alarmed about the overall dire state of freedom of expression in China.

Ai Weiwei was arrested on 3 April 2011 on undefined charges of “economic crimes”. His arrest was widely condemned in China and abroad, including by governments and leading figures in the fields of the arts and human rights. He was released on 22 June 2011 on bail. During his imprisonment he was denied access to his family and lawyers, leading to alarm about his well-being. On his release he refused to answer questions, only to say that he is not allowed to give interviews to the press, or use Twitter or other social media. He is also banned from leaving Beijing.

On 28 June, the Associated Press reported that on the previous day, tax bureau officials came to his home and delivered a notice believed to be related to a bill of around 5m yuan (c. Eur 600,000) in unpaid taxes and further fines of about 7m yuan (c. Eur 900,000), believed to relate to the past ten years. Ai is said to have refused to sign the notice. His mother is quoted as saying no tax demands of this kind had been sent in the past ten years. Ai’s supporters claim that he is being penalised for his criticism of the Chinese government. For more read: http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/jun/28/ai-weiwei-tax-bill-china?INTCMP=SRCH

Background
Ai Weiwei was detained at Beijing International Airport on 3 April 2011 while preparing to board a flight to Hong Kong, where he had been due to participate in artistic exchange activities. Later that day police raided his home and studio, questioned his wife and eight assistants, and confiscated computers. No news was given about his whereabouts or the reason for his arrest until 7 April 2011, when it was reported by the official Chinese News Agency Xinhua that Ai Weiwei was under investigation for suspected involvement in ‘economic crimes’. His arrest appears to be part of a widespread crackdown on dissent in which writers, journalists and human rights defenders are amongst those to have been targeted since mid-February 2011 (see previous alerts for details).

Ai Weiwei, aged 53, is an internationally recognized artist who co-designed the Olympic Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing. He is one of the most prominent of China's government critics, and has commented frequently on social injustice, including the detentions of fellow dissidents and government corruption, on his widely followed Twitter page and blog. In recent years Ai Weiwei has been repeatedly harassed, and in August 2009 was badly beaten by Chengdu police for attempting to testify in the trial of imprisoned dissident writer Tan Zuren, with whom Ai had worked on an investigation into student casualties of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. On 14 September 2009, Ai was diagnosed with a cerebral haemorrhage which is believed to be linked to the police attack, and he underwent emergency brain surgery at a hospital in Munich, Germany. In January 2011 his Shanghai studio was destroyed by the authorities.

Ai Weiwei's first book, Time and Place, was published by Guangxi Normal University Press in September 2010. The book is a collection of essays on art, architecture and reviews selected from his online publications in his blogs, which have been closed down since his detention. Its complete uncensored version in Chinese will be published in Hong Kong later this year.

Please send appeals:
- Welcoming the release on bail of Ai Weiwei, while expressing concerns that he remains under restriction, including denial of his right to freedom of expression;

- Asking for assurances that the tax evasion charges against him have not been applied in retaliation for his criticism of the government, concerns that are widely held within China and abroad;

- Reminding the Chinese authorities of their obligations under Article 35 of the Chinese constitution and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which it is a signatory and seeking assurances that these international commitments are being adhered to;

- Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all those currently detained in violation of their right to freedom of expression in China, as guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which China is a signatory

Please note that there are no fax numbers for the Chinese authorities. WiPC recommends that you copy your appeal to the Chinese embassy in your country asking them to forward it and welcoming any comments.

You may find it easier to write to the Chinese ambassador in your own country asking him or her to forward your appeal. Most embassies are obliged to forward such appeals to the relevant officials in the country. A letter or petition signed by an eminent member of your Centre may give make it more likely for your appeal to be considered. Similarly if your appeal is published in your local press and copied to the Chinese ambassador, this too may have greater impact.

**Please contact the PEN WiPC office in London if sending appeals after 15 July 2011**
