      <h1>Announcement</h1>
      <p><strong>The Norwegian Nobel Committee</strong></p>
      <br/>
      <h4><strong>The Nobel Peace Prize for 2010</strong></h4>
      <br/>
      <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for   2010 to Liu Xiaobo for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human   rights in China. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has long believed that there is a   close connection between human rights and peace. Such rights are a prerequisite   for the “fraternity between nations” of which Alfred Nobel wrote in his   will.</p>
      <p>Over the past decades, China has achieved economic advances to which history   can hardly show any equal. The country now has the world’s second largest   economy; hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. Scope   for political participation has also broadened.</p>
      <p>China’s new status must entail increased responsibility. China is in breach   of several international agreements to which it is a signatory, as well as of   its own provisions concerning political rights. Article 35 of China’s   constitution lays down that “Citizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy   freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and   of demonstration”. In practice, these freedoms have proved to be distinctly   curtailed for China’s citizens.</p>
      <p>For over two decades, Liu Xiaobo has been a strong spokesman for the   application of fundamental human rights also in China. He took part in the   Tiananmen protests in 1989; he was a leading author behind Charter 08, the   manifesto of such rights in China which was published on the 60th anniversary of   the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 10th of December   2008. The following year, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison and two   years’ deprivation of political rights for “inciting subversion of state power”.   Liu has consistently maintained that the sentence violates both China’s own   constitution and fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p>The campaign to establish universal human rights also in China is being waged   by many Chinese, both in China itself and abroad. Through the severe punishment   meted out to him, Liu has become the foremost symbol of this wide-ranging   struggle for human rights in China.</p>
