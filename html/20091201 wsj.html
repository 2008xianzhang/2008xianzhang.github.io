      <h1>The Fate of Liu Xiaobo </h1>
      <h2>More than just a dissident, he is a symbol of China's   democratic aspirations.</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div id="article_story_body">
        <div>
          <p>Next week marks two anniversaries for China: one year since dissident Liu   Xiaobo disappeared into the maw of the state-security apparatus, and one year   since the manifesto for political reform he helped draft, Charter 08, was made   public. As the country's human-rights situation continues to deteriorate, the   world must not forget Mr. Liu and the sacrifices he has made for China's   political modernization.</p>
          <p>The 53-year-old literature professor was formally arrested by police in June   and accused of &quot;agitation&quot; and &quot;subversion.&quot; His real crime was to give lie to   the idea that the Chinese people are unconcerned by the authoritarian nature of   their government. Since it was unveiled, Charter 08 has garnered thousands of   signatures of Chinese from all walks of life. That's despite the fact that   signatories knew at the very least they would be harassed by the authorities;   some were detained during President Obama's recent visit.</p>
          <p>These citizens took great personal risks simply to ask the government to live   up to ideals enshrined in its own constitution, ideals that have never been put   into practice. These include civil liberties such as freedom of expression and   equal protection under the law. The charter also calls for democratic elections   to form a government &quot;of the people, by the people, and for the people.&quot; </p>
          <p>President Obama reportedly raised Mr. Liu's case in private talks with   China's leaders this month. But so far that seems to have had little effect; his   detention without trial was recently extended for another two months. Defense   lawyer Mo Shaoping has been prevented from formally taking the case, on the   grounds that he is also a signatory to Charter 08.</p>
          <p>Maximum pressure from all quarters is needed for Mr. Liu's release, because   once an indictment is issued there is little chance that he will escape a long   prison sentence. Mr. Liu and Charter 08 are important symbols of the Chinese   people's yearning for political reform to accompany decades of successful   economic reforms. It is critical that he not suffer the fate of his   predecessors, many of whom vanished into the prison system and then were forced   abroad into exile.</p>

      <p>刘晓波不仅是异见人士，更是中国人民追求民主的象征。下周是两个周年纪念日：一个是异见人士刘晓波被国安拘捕1周年，另一个是《08宪章》公开发表1周年。随着国家人权状况的不断恶化，世界人民不应该忘记刘先生以及他为中国政治的民主化进程所作出的牺牲。</p>
      <p>这位53岁的文学教授于6月以&quot;煽动颠覆国家政权罪&quot;正式被捕入狱。他真正的罪行应该是他揭示出&quot;中国人民并不关心政府的独裁本质&quot;这一说法的欺骗性。</p>
      <p>政府独裁统治的本质被揭示之后，《08宪章》收集到来自各界上千人的签名。虽然签名者知道他们至少会受到骚扰，有些会在奥巴马访华期间被拘留。</p>
      <p>这些公民冒了极大的个人风险，只是想要政府履行其在自己的《宪法》中所规定的理想，这些理想从来都没有付诸过实践。这些理想包括：公民自由，比如言论自由和享有平等的法律保护。该宪章也呼吁通过民主选举来建立一个&quot;民享、民有和为人民的&quot;政府。</p>
      <p>据说，奥巴马这个月在与中国领导人的私下会谈中提到过刘先生的案子。但是，到目前为止，收效甚微；目前，他的拘留没有经过任何审判就又被延长了2个月。</p>
      <p>辩护律师莫小平一直无法正式接手这个案子，理由是，他也是《08宪章》的签署者。</p>
      <p>来自各方面的最大压力是要求释放刘先生，因为一旦发起起诉，他将没有什么机会逃脱长期监禁的判决。刘先生和他的《08宪章》是伴随着20年来成功的经济改革而来的中国人民渴求政治改革的象征。至关重要的是他不会受到他前辈的命运，他的许多前辈们消失在监狱制度中，然后被迫流亡海外。<br/>
