    <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Liu Xiaobo Formally Arrested   for “Inciting Subversion of State Power”</strong></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>(Chinese Human   Rights Defenders—June 24, 2009) – CHRD learned today that Liu Xiaobo (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">刘晓波</span>),   signatory of <em>Charter 08</em> and prominent   intellectual, was formally arrested for “inciting subversion of state power” on   June 23.  He had been detained since   December 8, 2008.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Police from the   Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) National Security Unit delivered Liu   Xiaobo’s formal arrest notice dated June 23 to his wife, Liu Xia (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">刘霞</span>),   at about 11 am today. The police also told Liu Xia that Mo Shaoping (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">莫少平</span>),   one of the best-known human rights lawyers in China,   cannot represent Liu Xiaobo, even though Liu Xia had retained Mo and Shang   Baojun (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">尚宝军</span>),   a lawyer from the Mo Shaoping Law Firm, to be Liu Xiaobo’s defense lawyers.   According to the authorities, Mo cannot be Liu Xiaobo’s lawyer because he is   also a signatory of <em>Charter 08</em>. Liu   Xiaobo’s detention and arrest are believed to be related to the authorities’   suspicions that he drafted <em>Charter 08</em> and organized the collection of signatures.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We expected that   Liu would be formally charged eventually,” said Mo. “I will fight the decision to bar me from   representing Mo in accordance with the law.”</p>
      <p>Liu Xiaobo is currently being subjected to   &quot;residential surveillance&quot; (jianshi juzhu), a form of pre-trial detention, at an   undisclosed location in Beijing. Liu has been   barred from contacting the outside world except for two meetings with his wife,   Liu Xia (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">刘霞</span>),   arranged by authorities, on January 1 and March 20 in Xiaotangshan, Changping   District, Beijing. </p>
      <p>Now that Liu Xiaobo has been formally arrested, he is expected   to be transferred to a detention center.  </p>
      <p>The crime of “inciting subversion of state power” is   stipulated under Article 105(2) of the Chinese Criminal   Code. If convicted, Liu faces a maximum of fifteen years of fixed-term   imprisonment.  Since its adoption in 1997, article 105(2) has been regularly used   by the authorities to criminalize freedom of   expression.  CHRD has documented dozens of cases of dissidents and free-speech activists persecuted under this law in recent years, including 2008 Sakharov Prize winner, Hu Jia   (<span lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">胡佳</span>), who is currently   serving a sentence of three and a   half years in prison.  For more   information, please see CHRD’s January 2008 report, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230926054948/http://www.crd-net.org/Article/Class9/Class11/200801/20080108225721_7032.html" target="_blank"><u>’Inciting Subversion of State Power’:   A Legal Tool for Prosecuting Free Speech in China</u></a>.”</p>
      <p><em>Charter 08</em> is a   manifesto calling for bold reforms promoting democracy and human rights in   China.  It was published on December 9, 2008, one day   after Liu Xiabo’s detention.  It   initially had over 303 signatories and now has more than 8,000. Over a hundred   signatories have been harassed, intimidated and persecuted by the authorities in   connection with <em>Charter 08</em>.  <u></u></p>
