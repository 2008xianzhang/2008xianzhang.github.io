各位：

　　在六四屠杀22周年之后，中共长期侵犯人权，最近再次展开对异议人士和民间活动人士的大规模抓捕和骚扰。我们必须采取行动，为此，我、韩连潮和一些朋友起草了一份致联合国安理会秘书长的公开信，要求联合国参照针对利比亚独裁者卡扎菲的1970号和1973号决议，对中共政权采取类似行动，现公布这份公开信的内容并在全球征集签名。我们将于2011年6月4日在联合国纽约总部门前举行新闻发布会，并向联合国递交这份公开信。这封公开信同时抄送联合国安全理事会各成员国，联合国人权理事会各成员国以及欧洲议会。

　　在这份公开信中，我们提出这样一个概念——依据类似联合国安理会1970和1973号决议案的标准来审视中国的人权侵犯者——是基于人类良知与道德的基本要求，联合国不应对成员国采取区别对待的方式，中国的人权侵犯者绝不可以因为中国在联合国的地位而逃避道德及法律惩罚。联合国应该对世界清楚地表达这一立场。

　　也许我们的诉求不会很快取得实质性进展，但作为一种概念的提出和意见表达，我相信这一公开信的诉求是正当的，如果中共继续坚持反人权、反民主的做法，早晚有一天，这样的诉求会成为现实。

　　这是一次全球行动，请各位积极参与、积极推动。作为全球纪念天安门屠杀22周年活动的组成部分，请海外的各位朋友联系所在国家的人权关注者参与签名，并向所在国（尤其是联合国安理会成员国、人权理事会成员国）的政府提出这一诉求，并递交该公开信副本，以最大限度地争取国际关注和支持。

　　请到为这次活动专设的信箱签名：p201164@gmail.com

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　2011年4月18日
　
致联合国秘书长的公开信
并致：
联合国安理会、联合国人权理事会及欧盟议会成员国

尊敬的秘书长先生：

　　二十二年前，中共独裁政权面对以学生为主的和平的民主运动，悍然动用数以万计的军队“平息反革命暴乱”。在难以想象的暴力行动中，全副武装的士兵和坦克攻击和平示威者。他们向天安门广场以及附近区域的手无寸铁的中国公民开枪，导致数以千计的人员死亡和伤残。

　　年轻的男女在坦克的履带下丧失生命，或成为残疾。另一些人死于士兵的枪林弹雨。母亲失去了他们的儿子和女儿；儿童成为孤儿，永远失去了父母的爱抚和拥抱；多少个家庭破碎了。这是现代中国历史上最为悲剧性的一天。

　　但那些下令屠杀的罪犯和他们的追随者却至今没有受到惩罚。其中一些人仍然占据目前中国政府的重要权力位置，他们在继续侵害中国公民的权益。

　　1998年，试图组建中国民主党的的人士被大量逮捕和判刑。1999年起，中国政府骚扰、监禁、折磨数以万计的法轮功修炼者，其中许多人死于这样的折磨和虐待。2008年，中国政府广泛迫害由刘晓波等发起的呼吁宪政改革的《零八宪章》签名人。2011年春，面对茉莉花革命的匿名网络呼吁，上百名异议人士和人权捍卫者被逮捕、拘留、被失踪。

　　遭受骚扰和拘留的不仅是中国的政治活动人士，中国政府还对在2008年四川地震中失去了孩子的父母进行监控和侮辱，其中有人因为和平请愿要求调查孩子的死因而被逮捕。同样的事发生在毒奶粉受害儿童的父母身上。长期以来，中国政府还实行了迫害基督徒、强迫堕胎、歧视压迫少数民族、非法拆迁、土地剥夺等残酷的政策。今天，任何一位中国公民都面临因为要求政府承担应有的责任而被贴上威胁国家安全的标签遭到迫害的危险。

　　我们希望您能注意到去年12月奥斯陆诺贝尔和平奖颁奖仪式上留给1989年的抗议者之一、2010年度该奖得主刘晓波的空椅子，目前他仍然被囚禁在中国监狱，他的妻子及全部家人被中国政府当做人质，这些的都是中国人权状况的缩影，应该引起您及国际社会的充分关注。

　　以上这些状况有一个清晰的起点，1989年6月4日。此后的所有人权侵犯都是天安门屠杀的延续。在过去的22年中，中国政府无情地镇压一切起而捍卫权力的个人、民族、信仰或公民组织。

　　我们可以说，在过去的22年中，中国共产党政府没有一天不在镇压以和平手段维护基本人权的活动人士和公民。这些镇压表明中国政府把自己置于国际人权标准和他们自己制定的法律之上。

　　中国政府对国内和国际规则的漠视和践踏使其成为超越国界的威胁。最近，卡扎菲就引用天安门屠杀来为自己寻求“正当性”辩护。卡扎菲敢于为杀人进行这种可耻的辩护，就因为国际社会未曾对中国独裁者的犯罪行为进行惩罚。

　　对于利比亚，我们由衷赞赏联合国安理会于今年通过的1970和1973号决议。我们也相信联合国应该做出更多努力来保护中国人民免受中国政府的人权侵犯。

　　我们相信《联合国宪章》和《世界人权宣言》以及其它国际人权公约和国际人权机制要求您即使面对成员国的威胁，也能坚持联合国的价值观。

　　我们强烈要求您将中国独裁者22年来的暴行提交联合国安理会，中国政府已经对国际和平和安全构成了严重威胁，这种威胁还在增加。联合国安理会有必要要求所有成员国，公开做出决定，针对中国政府对其人民的非人道对待，通过决议并采取公开行动：

　　一，要求中国政府立即停止重大而系统的人权侵犯；
　　二，采取必要的手段，禁止对于天安门屠杀及其它重大而系统的人权侵害负有责任的人进入国境；
　　三，冻结对天安门屠杀和其它重大而系统的人权侵犯负有责任的中国官员的现金及其它财产；
　　四，针对天安门屠杀和近期的人权侵犯，向国际刑事法庭提出起诉，安理会应展开调查并向法庭提出调查信息。

　　考虑到中国政府会利用其联合国安理会成员的地位阻止安理会通过一项明确的伸张正义的决定，我们强烈要求联合国成员召开紧急特别成员大会，通过决议（包含以上条款），要求中国对其大规模人权侵犯及违背国际条约义务的做出解释。

　　另外，联合国大会应该要求中国政府遵守其对人权条约的承诺，并允许对包括天安门屠杀在内的人权侵犯进行有信誉和独立的调查。大会应该要求秘书长在下次会议召开时就中国的人权状况向联合国人权理事会提交一份报告，并鼓励联合国人权理事会对中国残暴对待人民的问题建立特别的监控和报告机制。

　　如果现在不对中国政府采取行动，将纵容中国的独裁者继续其针对人民的犯罪行为，同时也是对国际上少数以中国模式作为榜样镇压和屠杀其人民的的独裁者构成支持。在这一问题上的无所作为，只能让联合国的人权声明成为笑料，并让世界的和平和安全处在严重的威胁之下。

此致
　　敬礼！

On June 4, 2011
Initiatives for China will present an
Open Letter to UN Secretary General Ban-ki Moon
regarding the Chinese government’s serious and on-going 
human rights violations against its own people

SIGN ON – Submit your signature at p201164@gmail.com

What kind of government systematically jails, tortures, disappears and harasses large numbers of its own people who dare to speak out in favor of democracy, justice and truth?

JUNE 4, 2011 marks the 22nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Unarmed Chinese university students who had gathered in the Square to peacefully demonstrate and show their support for democracy were overrun and mercilessly gunned down by heavily armed soldiers and armored tanks. Despite the outcry of world outrage, those political governmental leaders who authorized the slaughter are still in power today. Their policies of brutal persecution continue. 
1989 Students at Tiananmen Square Killed, jailed, detained, harassed 1998 Founders of the Chinese Democracy Party Jailed, detained, disappeared, harassed 2008 Signers of Charter 08 Jailed, detained, disappeared, harassed 2010 Winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize In solitary confinement, not allowed to receive visitors, not allowed to receive the Peace Prize, wife under house arrest; colleagues jailed, detained, disappeared &amp; harassed 2011 Participants in peaceful Jasmine Revolution demonstrations Jailed, detained, disappeared, harassed
Homes searched and property confiscated 

In addition to the above very specific examples, China’s on-going policies of repression extend over an extremely wide range:
Persecution and harassment of religious faiths
Diluting and degrading of ethnic cultures
Forced abortions – Families with more than their ‘quota’ of children are forced to undergo abortions to comply with China’s One Child Policy
Forced evictions – Homes demolished and property confiscated to make way for real estate development or events such as the Beijing Olympics, Shanghai Expo, and Disneyland projects
Families of victims of disasters such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the poisoned milk episodes are harassed, imprisoned, and humiliated when they seek justice for the loss of their children.

These and countless untold human rights violations occur every day in China. They are unspeakable acts of violence committed by a government against its own people.

And it is getting worse. While paying lip service to western countries, China is forging close relationships with world dictators which serve to strengthen and reinforce its current conduct rather than discourage it.

Initiatives for China’s open letter to the Secretary-General will call attention to this situation, and urge the U.N. to act now with all the administrative and diplomatic tools at its disposal. A series of steps outlined in the letter provide a suggested framework for such necessary and vital action. YOUR SIGNATURE IS RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED. Please add your signature to the letter and speak out in favor of democracy and justice for those who voices cannot be heard. Sign on to show the U.N. Secretariat that the world is watching and waiting for their response. P201164@gmail.com

Open Letter to the Secretary-General of United Nations
His Excellency Ban Ki-moon 
The United Nations 
1 United Nations Plaza 
New York, New York 10017-3515 
CC: Member States of the UN Security Council, Member States of the UN Human Rights Council, and European Parliament
June 4, 2011 

Dear Mr. Secretary-General: 

Twenty-two years ago today, Chinese Communist dictators, responding to student-led pro-democracy protests, called out tens of thousands of troops to “crush a counter-revolutionary riot." In a spasm of unimaginable violence, heavily armed soldiers and tanks attacked peaceful protesters. They shot at unarmed Chinese in and near Tiananmen Square, resulting in the death and maiming of thousands of their own citizens. 

Young men and women vanished beneath tank tracks or lost their limbs. Others perished in a hail of gunfire from soldiers using assault rifles. Mothers lost their only sons and daughters. Children were orphaned, left to forever miss their parent’s love and warm embrace. Families were shattered. This was the single most tragic day in the history of modern China. 

The criminals who authorized this evil bloodletting and the henchmen who committed it on their behalf – these killers were left unpunished. And some still occupy positions of power inside China’s present day government where they continue to abuse Chinese citizens. 
In 1998, the regime engaged in mass arrests and imprisonment of democracy activists attempting to form their own political parties. In 1999, it began a campaign of harassment, imprisonment and torture of tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners, many of whom died from this brutality. In 2008, the regime persecuted the signers of Charter 08 led by Liu Xiaobo to call for a constitutional reform. After anonymous calls by Chinese people for a Jasmine Revolution in February, more arrests, detentions and disappearances of dissidents and human rights defenders followed. 

And it is not only political activists who face constant harassment and detention. The Chinese government has heaped additional pain and insult on the parents of children who died in the 2008 earthquake by arresting them for peacefully petitioning their government for the truth about their children’s death. The same has happened to parents of children who died from drinking tainted milk. For decades, the Chinese government has been implementing its cruel policies of forced abortions, large-scale illegal evictions, and land grabbing and acquisition without just compensation. Today, all of China’s citizens are in danger of being labeled as “a national threat”, simply for asking their own government for accountability.

We draw your attention to the empty chair at the peace prize ceremony this past December in Oslo for a June 4th protests leader, Liu Xiaobo, who is still jailed in the Chinese prison, and for his entire extended family, including his wife, being held hostage now by the Chinese regime, to alert you to an ever worsening human right situation in China.

This situation has a clear starting point – June 4th, 1989 – and all subsequent gross human rights violations are a continuation of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Over the past 22 years, the Chinese regime has ruthlessly suppressed any individual, or ethnic, religious or civic group that stands up to defend their own rights. Every corner of China—from Lhasa to Urumqi to Beijing—is experiencing systematic human rights violations.

We can tell you that not a single day has gone by within the past 22 years without the Chinese Communist regime “cracking down” on peaceful activists and citizens defending their rights. These crackdowns serve to prove that the Chinese regime feels itself to be above international human rights norms and the expressed laws made by the regime itself in its own constitution. 

The regime’s willingness to abrogate both domestic and international rules is a threat to people well beyond China’s borders. Just recently, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi justified his slaughtering of Libyan citizens by citing the Tiananmen Square Massacre in China. Gaddafi could only dare to make this type of disgraceful justification for murder because the international community had failed then, and fails now, to punish China’s Communist dictators’ past and current criminal behavior. 

With respect to Libya, we wholeheartedly applaud United Nations’ Security Council Resolution Number 1970 and Resolution Number 1973 adopted this year. Yet we also believe the UN should be doing far more to address the protection of China’s civilian population from continuing violations of Chinese citizens’ human rights. 

We believe that the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments require you, the 
Secretary-General, to uphold the values of the UN, even at the risk of challenging Member States. 

We strongly urge you to bring to the attention of the UN Security Council the past and current atrocities committed by China’s Communist dictators, which have imposed a serious and growing threat to international peace and security. It is imperative that the Security Council openly and publicly address China’s inhumane treatment of its own people by passing a resolution requiring that all Member States: 

demand an immediate end to the gross and systematic violation of human rights in China; 

take necessary measures to prevent the entry into or transit through their territories of individuals who are responsible for the Tiananmen Square Massacre, or for other gross and systematic violations of human rights in China; 

freeze all funds, other financial assets and economic resources which are on their territories, which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the individuals responsible for the Tiananmen Square Massacre or for other gross and systematic violations of human rights in China; 

refer the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and the recent crimes against the Chinese citizens, to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court; the Council shall provide information regarding these crimes against humanity to the Prosecutor to initiate investigations proprio motu. 

Should China use its UN prerogatives to prevent the UN Security Council from adopting a well-defined resolution, we strongly urge UN Members to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly to adopt a resolution (including the above-mentioned provisions) to hold China accountable for its gross human rights violations and for its failure to abide by its international treaty obligations. 

Additionally, the General Assembly resolution must call on the Chinese government to fully respect its human rights obligations and allow credible and independent investigations of all allegations of human rights violations, including the Tiananmen Square Massacre. It must also request the Secretary-General to submit an interim report assessing the situation of China’s human rights abuses to the Human Rights Council at its next session and to encourage the UN Human Rights Council to establish a special monitoring and reporting mechanism on China’s inhumane treatment of its people. 

Failure to act now against the Chinese regime will not only encourage that dictatorship to continue its crimes against the Chinese people, but also bolster the remaining handful of dictators in the world who shield themselves behind the “Chinese model” to justify continual repression and slaughter of their own people. Inaction on the regime only makes a laughingstock out of the UN human rights proclamations, and presents a dire threat to international peace and security.

Yours sincerely, 

Signed by
