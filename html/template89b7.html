奥巴马关于本拉登之死的演讲全文中文翻译：

今晚，我可以向美国人民和世界报告，美国在一次行动中杀死了基地组织领导人、恐怖分子奥沙马・本・拉登。他是谋杀数千名无辜男性、女性和儿童的元凶。

几乎10年以前，美国人民遭到我们有史以来最恶劣的一次袭击，它的阴云掩盖了9月明朗的天空。9.11的惨景被烙印在我们国家的记忆中：

被劫持的客机划过9月的晴空。世贸双塔轰然崩塌。五角大楼上空黑烟弥漫。93航班坠毁在宾西法尼亚州山克斯维尔，机上民众的英勇行为让更多的人免于伤心欲决，令更多的生命免于毁灭。

但是，我们知道，最凄惨的景象并不为世界所知：晚餐桌边的空椅子。被夺去父母的儿童。再也感受不到子女拥抱的双亲。

近3，000位公民被夺去生命，在我们的心中留下巨大的空洞。

2001年9月11日，美国人民在悲痛中团结在一起。我们向邻人伸出援手。我们向伤者奉献鲜血。我们巩固了彼此间的纽带，巩固了我们对社会和国家的爱。

那一天，无论我们从哪里来，无论我们信仰哪位神明，无论种族与民族，我们团结成为美国大家庭。我们更因为我们保卫国家、缉拿凶手、伸张正义的决心而团结在一起。

我们很快得知，9.11袭击的凶手是奥沙马・本・拉登领导的基地组织。该组织已公开向美国宣战，不遗馀力地杀害在国内及世界各地的美国人。于是，为了保卫我们的公民，我们的友邦和盟国，我们与基地组织开战。

在过去10年中，在我们的军人和反恐人士英勇不懈的战斗下，我们取得了巨大成就。我们挫败了多起恐怖袭击，增强了国土防卫能力。在阿富汗，我们推翻了向本・拉登和基地组织提供庇护和支持的塔利班政府。在全球范围内，我们与朋友和盟军合作，逮捕击毙了数以百计的基地组织恐怖分子，包括参与9.11阴谋的一些人。

但奥沙马・本・拉登逃脱了追捕，跨过阿富汗边境进入巴基斯坦。与此同时，基地组织继续在边境线上活动，并通过与其相关的组织在全球肆虐。

于是，在就任後不久，我命令中情局局长莱昂・帕涅塔把捕杀本・拉登作为我们针对基地组织战争的头等要务，同时，我们并未停止破坏、打垮、击败其恐怖网络的战斗。

在多年艰苦的工作後，我们的情报系统在去年八月向我汇报了本・拉登可能的线索。我们花了数月时间调查核实这一线索。

在获取更多情报後，我与国家安全团队多次开会，判断出本・拉登可能躲藏在巴基斯坦腹地的一个营地中。

最终，我于上周确认，我们已经获得足够的情报，可以采取行动。我授权了针对本・拉登的行动，将他绳之以法。

今天，在我的指挥下，美国针对巴基斯坦阿巴德阿巴德的一个营地采取了目标明确的行动。执行任务的美国小队以非凡的胆识和实力完成了任务。美国人没有伤亡，他们还特别注意，避免了平民伤亡。

在武装战斗中，他们打死了本・拉登，取回了他的尸体。

二十多年来，本・拉登一直是基地组织的领导人和象征，从未间断过袭击我们国家、我们的友邦和盟国的阴谋。

本・拉登之死，标志着在我们打击基地组织的斗争中迄今为止最大的胜利。

但他的死亡并不意味着斗争的结束。毫无疑问，基地组织将继续图谋袭击我们。无论在国内国外，我们必将保持警惕。

与此同时，我们必须重申，美国没有、并且永远不会针对伊斯兰世界宣战。我曾经声明、布什总统在9.11後不久也宣称，我们的斗争并不是针对伊斯兰世界的。本・拉登不是穆斯林领袖，而是大规模屠杀穆斯林民众的凶手。基地组织在多个国家，包括在美国，杀害了众多穆斯林民众。

所以，所有信仰和平和人类尊严的人们都应该为本・拉登之死而欢呼。近年来，我曾多次声明，如果我们发现本・拉登在巴基斯坦的藏身之所，我们就将展开行动。我们做到了这一点。

但有必要强调，我们与巴基斯坦的反恐合作帮助我们找到本・拉登及其藏身之所。实际上，本・拉登也向巴基斯坦宣战，并下令袭击巴基斯坦人民。

今晚，我与扎尔达里总统通了电话，我的团队成员也与他们的巴基斯坦同事作了沟通。他们同意，这对我们两国来说都是良好的、历史性的一天。未来，巴基斯坦继续与我们合作打击基地组织及其相关组织，这一点至关重要。

美国人民并未挑起这场战争。是恐怖分子侵入我们的国土，毫无理由地残杀我们的人民，挑起了这次战争。在将近10年的服役、斗争和牺牲後，我们深知战争的代价。

作为总指挥，每次我签署向阵亡者家属的慰问信时，每次我与负伤者对望时，我都深感他们做出的巨大牺牲。

所以，美国人民懂得战争的代价。但作为一个国家，我们决不能容忍我们的安全遭到威胁，在我们的人民遭到杀害时更不会无所作为。在保卫我们的公民，我们的友邦和盟国时，我们将勇往直前。我们将对造就我们的价值观保持永远忠诚。

就是在今天这样的夜晚，我们终于可以告慰痛失亲人的家庭：正义得到了伸张。

今夜，我们感谢无数情报和反恐工作人员，他们的艰苦工作成就了这一胜利。美国人民并不了解他们的工作，也不知道他们的名字，但今晚，他们感受到了工作的成就，追求正义的战果。

我们感谢执行这次任务的人们。他们向所有服务于国家的人士做出了专业精神、爱国主义和卓绝胆识的最佳表率。他们也是9.11以来背负最沉重压力的一代人。

最後，让我向所有在9.11事件中失去亲人的家庭说，我们从未忘记过你们的痛苦，我们的决心也从未动摇：为了避免悲剧再次发生，我们愿意付出任何代价。

今晚，让我们回想9.11之後全国上下团结一心的情形。我知道，自那时以来，我们的团结也曾有所动摇。但今天的胜利证明了我们国家的伟大，证明了美国人民的坚韧。

保卫国家的事业并未完成，但今晚我们再次证明，美国人民只要下定决心，就能完成任何目标。这就是我们的历史。无论是为人民追求繁荣，为全体民众的平等而斗争，在海外保卫我们的价值观，还是为维护世界和平而做出牺牲。

让我们牢记，我们能够完成上述目标，并不仅仅是源于我们的财富和实力，而是我们的身份和信仰所致——我们是上帝庇护的国度，追求自由和正义，无人能够分裂我们。

谢谢大家。上帝保佑大家。上帝保佑美国。

Full text of Obama's speech on bin Laden's death

THE PRESIDENT: Good evening. Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.

It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history. The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.

And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world. The empty seat at the dinner table. Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father. Parents who would never know the feeling of their child's embrace. Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.

On September 11, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together. We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood. We reaffirmed our ties to each other, and our love of community and country. On that day, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family.

We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice. We quickly learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda -- an organization headed by Osama bin Laden, which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe. And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies.

Over the last 10 years, thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals, we've made great strides in that effort. We've disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense. In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban government, which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support. And around the globe, we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists, including several who were a part of the 9/11 plot.

Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan. Meanwhile, al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world.

And so shortly after taking office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.

Then, last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden. It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan. And finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.

Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.

For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda.

Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort. There's no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must -- and we will -- remain vigilant at home and abroad.

As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. I've made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam. Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own. So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.

Over the years, I've repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was. That is what we've done. But it's important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding. Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.

Tonight, I called President Zardari, and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts. They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations. And going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.

The American people did not choose this fight. It came to our shores, and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens. After nearly 10 years of service, struggle, and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war. These efforts weigh on me every time I, as 

Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member who's been gravely wounded.

So Americans understand the costs of war. Yet as a country, we will never tolerate our security being threatened, nor stand idly by when our people have been killed. We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies. We will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda's terror: Justice has been done.

Tonight, we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who've worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. The American people do not see their work, nor know their names. But tonight, they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.

We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country. And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.

Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 that we have never forgotten your loss, nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores.

And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people.

The cause of securing our country is not complete. But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history, whether it's the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens; our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place.

Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Thank you. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
