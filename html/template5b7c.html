作者为代表佛罗里达州的美国参议员。

亲爱的刘霞女士：

虽然我们素未谋面，我和全球数百万人一起，为您的丈夫刘晓波先生的辞世致以最深切的哀悼！他数十年来长期坚持的为争取人权和结束中国的一党专制的和平抗争，不仅赢得了诺贝尔和平奖形式的国际荣誉，也赢得了包括我在内的无数仰慕者继续追随他的理想。

华盛顿特区的决策者们仍在讨论如何更好地弘扬刘晓波的人生和他的遗产，与此同时人们越来越迫切地意识到您个人的困境。几乎没有人相信中国政府声明的您是自由的。这个声明来自于这样的一群人，7年来他们冷酷地剥夺了您与外界几乎所有的联系，迫使您生活在隔离状态和不间断的监控之中。对您非法的软禁引起国际上的愤慨，尤其是事实上从未对您提出过任何罪名指控。类似地，声称您目前正被“保护”起来而与记者、支持者和朋友们隔离是为了你好的中国政府，此前可耻地拒绝尊重您和您丈夫寻求出国就医的愿望，他们的话显得虚伪空洞。

许多美国人和世界各地的人都认为，上述种种和其他的不公正均应被问责。美国现行法律规定，总统有权强制执行签证禁令，冻结任何压制基本人权的外国公民的资产。中国政府对您和您丈夫的迫害显然符合这个标准。包括制裁在内的其他措施均可施加。我担心如果中国政府没有为对您的丈夫、可以说是中国最著名的政治犯的迫害付出相应的代价，这将对千千万万像他一样的人发出一个毁灭性的讯息，他们的名字可能不为我们所知，但他们日常承受着骚扰、监禁、剥夺权利、拒绝治疗、酷刑折磨等等。

关于您已故丈夫的葬礼、火化和抛撒骨灰的消息，以及中国政府围绕这些事件的紧张的叙述，进一步证明了中共对您丈夫和他的精神遗产的恐惧。中国官员不允许保留墓地，无疑是他们担忧那将成为渴望看到您丈夫设想的民主、自由和尊重所有人基本权利的中国的抗议者和同情者们的一个朝圣之所。所幸，刘晓波的理念不会被时间或地域所制约，尽管中国的审查官员们继续不断阻挠，他的民主中国之梦不会被湮灭。

在一些您丈夫的讣告和悼辞中，均提到他在1989年的关键决定：中止在美国纽约哥伦比亚大学的访问回到中国，参加天安门广场正如火如荼的要求民主的抗议活动。近三十年前，成千上万的中国公民走上街头，开始时充满希望的呼吁最终遭至流血的结局，然而故事并未就此结束。在接下来的几年，刘晓波以他的道德感召力和政治评论——包括在他被拘留和监禁期间——保留了无论在中国国内或是流亡海外的中国公民对自由和政治改革的希望。他倡导言论自由，旗帜鲜明地表达对批评和独立思考的支持。他在起草和征集零八宪章签名中的领导作用，表明他愿意公开地表达自己的信念并激励他人。他的卓越的诗歌创作，表达了对您的爱慕和尊重，也彰显了他的精神和人格的高度。在其缺席的诺贝尔颁奖礼演讲中，刘晓波预言：“中国的政治进步不会停止，我对未来自由中国的降临充满乐观的期待，因为任何力量也无法阻拦心向自由的人性欲求，中国终将变成人权至上的法治国。”

我认同他的信念。您和您的家人为此付出了巨大代价，但我们要牢记，历史并不站在暴君或压迫者一边，独裁政权终将进入“历史的垃圾堆”，再不能压制人民的普遍愿望。在天安门广场大屠杀几个月之后，柏林墙倒塌，苏联垮台。历史潮流浩荡前行，我祈祷在我们有生之年，当刘晓波的多方面贡献终获承认，他的梦想也将在他出生的那片土地得以实现。

此致

马可·鲁比奥参议员

Sen. Marco Rubio: An Open Letter to Liu Xia, Widow of Liu Xiaobo

Marco Rubio
Jul 25, 2017

Rubio is a U.S. Senator for Florida.

Dear Ms. Liu Xia,
While we have not had the occasion to meet, I join with millions around the globe in extending my deepest condolences on the loss of your husband, Liu Xiaobo. His decades’ long peaceful fight for human rights and the end to one-party rule in China earned not only international honors in the form of the Nobel Peace Prize, but also countless admirers, myself among them, who continue to stand in solidarity with his aspirations.
Even as there are discussions underway among policymakers in Washington, D.C., about how best to honor Liu Xiaobo’s life and legacy, there is a growing sense of urgency regarding your own plight. Few take at face value the Chinese government’s claims that you are free. This claim comes from the same people who have callously deprived you of nearly all contact with the outside world for seven years, forcing you to live in virtual isolation and under constant surveillance. Your illegal home confinement is a source of international outrage, especially given the fact that you’ve never had charges brought against you. Similarly, the Chinese government’s assertions that you are currently being “protect[ed]” from reporters, supporters and friends for your own good ring hollow given its shameful refusal to honor you and your husband’s wishes to seek medical treatment outside of China.
Many Americans and people around the world believe these and other injustices demand accountability. Current U.S. law gives the President of the United States the authority to impose visa bans and to freeze the assets of any foreign citizens who suppress basic human rights; surely the Chinese government’s treatment of you and your husband meets this standard. Other measures, including sanctions, can be brought to bear. I fear that if there is no price to pay for the Chinese government’s treatment of your husband, arguably China’s most prominent political prisoner, it will send a devastating message to thousands more like him, whose names we may not know but whose harassment, imprisonment, deprivation of rights, denial of medical treatment, torture in detention, and more, are daily realities.
News accounts of your late husband’s funeral service and cremation, the scattering of his ashes, and the Chinese government’s tightly scripted narrative surrounding these events, are further evidence of Chinese Communist Party’s fear of your husband and his legacy. Chinese officials’ refusal to allow for a gravesite was no doubt due to their concern it would serve as a pilgrimage site for protesters and sympathizers who yearn to see China as your husband envisioned it: democratic, free and respectful of the basic rights of all its people. Fortunately, the principles Liu Xiaobo embodied are not bound by time or place, and his dream of democracy in China cannot be extinguished, despite the relentless efforts of China’s censors.
Several obituaries and tributes to your husband have rightly noted his pivotal decision in 1989 to leave behind a fellowship at Columbia University in New York and return to China to join the blossoming pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. What began as hopeful calls for change drawing thousands of Chinese citizens to the streets ended in bloodshed nearly 30 years ago, but the story did not end there. In the ensuing years, Liu Xiaobo’s moral leadership and political commentary — including through periods of detention and imprisonment — maintained the hopes of Chinese citizens in China and in exile who believe in freedom and political reform. His advocacy of free expression demonstrated his fierce support to critical and independent thinking. His leadership in drafting and enlisting signatories of Charter 08 showed his willingness to publicly voice his beliefs and inspire others. His exquisite poetry, in which he expressed his love and respect for you, revealed his depth of spirit and character. In his Nobel lecture delivered in absentia, Liu Xiaobo predicted that “China's political progress will not stop, and I, filled with optimism, look forward to the advent of a future free China. For there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and China will in the end become a nation ruled by law, where human rights reign supreme.”
I share his conviction. You and your family have paid a great price in pursuit of this end, but we must remember that history is not on the side of tyrants or oppressors. The “ash heap of history” is littered with authoritarian governments who could no longer suppress the universal aspirations of their people. Months after the Tiananmen Square Massacre, the Berlin Wall came down and with it the Soviet Union. The tides of history often move swiftly, and I pray for the day, in our lifetime, when Liu Xiaobo’s manifold contributions are properly recognized, and his dream realized, in the land of his birth.

Sincerely,
Senator Marco Rubio</textarea><br/>
