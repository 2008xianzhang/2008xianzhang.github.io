周六随着陈光诚胜利逃亡的更多细节曝光，人们更清楚地看到，在上一周，对于陈光诚本人、及冒着被捕危险帮助他逃往北京“安全地带”的那些人士，他们的经历有多困难、多危险。

尽管当局的监视设备无处不在，（在中国）有这样一种“网络”，能帮助中国最著名的人权人士之一-陈光诚逃出虎口。

他的朋友们说，上周日，陈光诚翻过家里的院墙时，不但没有被看守发现，而且他因为慢性腹泻及一条腿被看守打伤而身体虚弱，他后来设法逃出了家院和村附近的看守布阵，从山东农村逃到了300英里外的北京。

朋友们说，陈光诚上周日的“突围”非常成功，以致当地的官员们直到周四才发现他不见了。

“他逃出来只能说是一个奇迹”，人权活动人士曾金燕说。上周陈光诚在北京被从一个安全地点转移到另一安全地点期间，曾金燕曾有一段时间和陈光诚在一起。

曾金燕和其他一些朋友，及中国政府的一些人士称，陈光诚目前在北京的美国大使馆内，官员们正在那里试图谈判外交解决方案，以确保陈光诚及其尚留在山东老家的家人的安全，并尽量减少美中之间的关系破裂。周六，美方官员仍然保持沉默，拒绝回答陈光诚是否在大使馆内。

在过去的数月间，中国的人权活动人士试图让人们关注陈光诚的困境，并有数十人前往他居住的东师古村，希望探望陈光诚，并挑战当局对他的软禁。 其中很多人在微博上公布他们的东师古之行都是以同样方式结束：受雇的看守们用暴力赶跑来访者，以保持让陈光诚及家人“与世隔绝”。

40岁的陈光诚，长期以来在海内外人权倡导者中是明星人物。他直到20多岁还是一名文盲，后来靠自学成才成为律师，并为被剥夺权利的农民和残疾人打官司而获得美誉。但他因代表山东当地被强制堕胎和结扎的妇女提出集体诉讼，激怒了当地的“计生”官员。

2006年，陈光诚被关进监狱。很多法律专家称，当局对他的这些指控都是捏造的。监禁了51个月后，他被押解回他在山东东师古的老家。当地官员决定让他“保持沉默”。他们把陈光诚家变成了一个临时监狱-有看守、监视摄像机和干扰设备，以确保他无法与外界联系。陈光诚的妻子和年幼的女儿也被限制在屋内，虽然当局后来允许他女儿在警卫的“陪同”下上学。

他们家被禁闭的详情去年传了出来。陈光诚和其妻子袁伟静，偷偷录制了一段家庭视频。人权人士们称，当该视频被放到网上后，“绑匪们”对陈光诚夫妇展开了一系列的殴打，这些伤害至今仍让陈光诚行走困难。一位朋友说，当警卫们发现陈光诚试图在家里挖一条逃跑隧道时，对他的看守就变得更加严厉。

有关陈光诚本次出逃的很多细节仍不清楚，但支持者们说，他可能得到了其中一名同情其处境的看守的帮助。他们还说，在陈光诚逃跑的前一天晚上，他可以通过手机跟支持者们讨论他的计划，这是一个了不起的细节，因为那些看守们一直在努力切断他与外界的联系。

朋友们说，在最近几星期，陈光诚一直连续躺在床上，让看守他的人以为他已经虚弱得走不了路，或是虚弱得不可能逃跑。

作为出逃计划的一部分，他的妻子留下来分散那些驻守在他家门口的看守们的注意力。

在他爬过家里的院墙后，据报道，他花了20小时，才抵达预先决定用车接应他的地点。据南京人权人士何培荣的微博披露，之后是她开着自己的车，把陈光诚送到北京。

她在周五上午写道：“现在，陈光诚要么就在一个安全的地方，要么就在北京的国安手中。”她写下这个不久，就在南京家中被当局带走。周六，记者仍然无法联系到这位女士，她的微博帐户已被禁用。

据著名异议人士及艾滋病活动家胡佳表示，他上周在北京与陈光诚见过面，陈光诚在后来的三天受到一个由支持者们组成的松散的人网保护。

也一直受到当局监视的胡佳表示，这个“网络”由五个人组成。当陈光诚在北京的那几天，这个“团体”在疯狂地试图找到一种方式，保护他的安全。胡佳说，“经决定，在中国只有一个地方是绝对安全的，这就是美国大使馆。”

胡佳说，他肯定陈光诚成功抵达了美国大使馆，因为那些支持者们已设立了通信暗语。周五，他收到事先设定的暗号称，成功把陈光诚送达那里。

在美国德州的基督教团体“对华援助”也帮助协调了把陈光诚带到安全地点的行动。其会长傅希秋表示，他不会提供很多细节。

虽然他们在庆祝陈光诚的逃离，但活动人士们担心，当局必然会进行报复。周六，这种报复出现上升势头。周四晚，陈光诚的大哥被地方当局带走，他们还在试图寻找抓捕他大哥的儿子。人权倡导者们说，他们担心陈光诚的妻子和母亲，也可能处在严重危险之中。

除了开车把陈光诚从山东送往北京的何培荣外，在北京的学者和活动家郭玉闪，自周五向朋友们说他遭到公安的人跟踪后而“失踪”。周六，胡佳的妻子曽金燕说，胡佳也被警方带走。

Daring Circle, Now at Risk, Aided Activist’s Flight in China
By ANDREW JACOBS
Published: April 28, 2012

BEIJING — For months, Chen Guangcheng, one of China’s best-known dissidents, played a cat-and-mouse game with the phalanx of guards encircling his home. He dug a tunnel to try to escape, a friend says, but was found out. And he sneaked out a video that alerted his supporters to the smothering confinement he said he and his wife endured at the hands of the men who kept them virtual prisoners in their rural farmhouse.

An undated photograph of Chen Guangcheng with his family. The escape of the activist, who is blind, was months in the planning.

Then last Sunday night, in an improbable escape, Mr. Chen, who is blind and reportedly weak from months of mistreatment, scaled the wall that had been built around his house, slipped past his security detail and made a desperate sprint to apparent safety in Beijing. The daring rush for freedom could not have been possible without a small network of activists who risked detention to help him and who, supporters with knowledge of the escape said, used coded messages to communicate and elude a surveillance apparatus that is one of the world’s most pervasive.

By Saturday, three activists who had either helped him or had been advocates in the past had disappeared, including the woman who drove Mr. Chen more than 300 miles to Beijing and a man who admitted to meeting the dissident as he was shuttled between safe houses in the capital. The man’s wife said he was taken away by the police.

Friends of Mr. Chen, along with people in the Chinese government, say he is now inside the American Embassy in Beijing. If true, that creates diplomatic headaches for the United States just days before Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other American officials arrive for annual talks.

That the underground network of activists was able to help Mr. Chen evade his captors and move around the capital undetected for days has undoubtedly shaken Chinese leaders, who have become increasingly determined to suppress dissent through technology and brute force. Friends say his escape was so well executed that local officials did not realize until Thursday that he was gone.

“His escape is nothing less than a miracle,” said Zeng Jinyan, a human rights campaigner who also spent time with Mr. Chen last week.

Mr. Chen’s flight could not have come at a worse time for China’s leaders, who were already struggling to limit the fallout from the case of Bo Xilai, the center of a cascading scandal that cost him his seat in the Politburo and exposed internal divisions among top officials in the one-party state.

News of Mr. Chen’s improbable odyssey has electrified China’s rights activists, scores of whom had sought for months to draw attention to his plight and to challenge his extralegal detention by flocking to Dongshigu village in futile attempts to see him. The journeys, many of them publicized through social media, always ended the same way: The guards paid to keep Mr. Chen and his family incommunicado would use violence to drive visitors away.

Mr. Chen, 40, has long been a cause célèbre among human rights advocates both in China and abroad. A self-taught lawyer who was illiterate well into his 20s, Mr. Chen earned renown by defending disenfranchised peasants and the disabled. But he infuriated local officials in Shandong Province after filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of women forced to undergo abortions and sterilizations under the country’s strict family-planning policy.

In 2006, he was convicted on charges that many legal experts say were trumped up. After serving his 51-month sentence, he was escorted back to Dongshigu, where local officials were determined to keep him silent. They turned his home into a makeshift prison, surrounding it with guards, surveillance cameras and a jamming device to ensure that he could not communicate with the outside world. His wife and young daughter were also confined to the house, although the daughter was later allowed to attend school accompanied by guards.

Many details of the escape remain murky, but supporters say Mr. Chen may have been aided by a sympathetic guard. They also say that the night before his escape, he was able to discuss his plans with supporters via cellphone — a remarkable detail given how hard the guards had worked to keep him isolated.

Friends said Mr. Chen’s subterfuge was months in the making. In recent weeks, they said, he stayed in bed continuously to convince his minders that he was too weak to walk, or to try to leave.

As part of the plan, his wife stayed behind to distract the guards stationed outside the front door. 

After he scaled the wall outside his home, he hid somewhere before making his way to a predetermined pickup spot almost a day after leaving home. It was then that He Peirong, a rights activist from Nanjing, arrived in her car and drove Mr. Chen to Beijing, according to the account she posted on her microblog account.

“Now Chen Guangcheng is either in a safe place or in the hands of State Security in Beijing,” she wrote Friday morning, shortly before the authorities in Nanjing arrived at her home and took her away, according to a fellow activist who was on the phone with her at the time. Ms. He remained unreachable on Saturday, and her microblog account has been disabled.

According to Hu Jia, a well-known dissident and AIDS activist who met with him in Beijing last week, Mr. Chen, who had arrived in the capital on Monday, spent the subsequent three days protected by a loose network of supporters who made sure he slept in a different apartment each night.

Mr. Hu, who has been under constant surveillance, said the network consisted of five people. After several frantic days, he said, “It was decided that there was only one place in China that is absolutely safe, and that’s the U.S. Embassy.”

He said he was certain that Mr. Chen had made it to the embassy, because on Friday he received a predetermined coded message confirming that Mr. Chen had made it there.

China Aid, a Christian organization in Texas that has a network of supporters here, said it was willing to help Mr. Chen leave the country, but he was determined to stay in China, according to Bob Fu, the group’s president. “I tried to offer him the underground railroad, but the offer was declined,” he said.

Even as they celebrated Mr. Chen’s flight, activists worried about the backlash that appeared to be building. On Thursday night, Mr. Chen’s brother was taken away by the local authorities, his family said, and state news media reported that his son was also being sought. Human rights advocates say they fear that Mr. Chen’s wife and mother may also be in grave danger.

Several of those who assisted Mr. Chen or publicly advocated on his behalf apparently have also been detained. In addition to Ms. He, the activist who drove him to Beijing, Guo Yushan, a scholar in Beijing, has been missing since Friday, after telling friends he was being trailed by security agents. And shortly after talking to a reporter on Saturday, Mr. Hu, the AIDS activist, was taken away by the police, his wife said.

Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Mr. Chen’s escape highlighted the organizational prowess of Chinese rights activists in the face of increasingly sophisticated surveillance. But he acknowledged that the success came at a price.

“It’s hard to call this a victory if everyone involved in his escape ends up detained, arrested and imprisoned,” he said.
