      <p>Liu's lawyer says investigators claim author incited subversion, which carries a   maximum 15-year jail term</p>
      <p>Chinese police have presented the case against one of the country's most   prominent dissidents to prosecutors, after detaining him for a year.</p>
      <p>Liu Xiaobo's lawyer Shang Baojun said the investigators' report alleged that   the author incited the subversion of state power through articles he published   on the internet and by helping to write Charter 08, an appeal for democratic   reforms and greater civil liberties.</p>
      <p>His wife Liu Xia said she learned that police had finished their report last   night – exactly one year after officers took her husband from their home. He was   formally arrested six months later.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week she said she was losing hope that he would be released and   feared he could face more than a decade in prison. Inciting subversion carries a   maximum jail term of 15 years.</p>
      <p>The 53-year-old's case has drawn protests from western politicians and   international authors.</p>
      <p>&quot;If the procuratorate concludes that the public security agency has clearly   established a case backed by evidence, then it can decide to initiate a   prosecution in court,&quot; said Mo Shaoping, another of Liu's lawyers.</p>
      <p>Over the next month and half, prosecutors also have the options of ordering   additional investigations or throwing out the case, said Mo.</p>
      <p sizcache="0" sizset="34">But Phelim Kine, Asia researcher at <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Human rights" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231003232417/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/human-rights">Human Rights</a> Watch,   said: &quot;The sad fact is by the time it does get to this point, it takes on a   momentum of its own and [probably] will unfortunately head to court.</p>
      <p sizcache="0" sizset="35">&quot;There have been entreaties from the highest level   and the Chinese government has been resistant to them all, apparently. It   underlines an increasing intolerance of perceived dissent in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on China" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231003232417/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china">China</a> – particularly [if]   questioning the Communist party's monopoly on power.&quot;</p>
      <p>Liu, a literary critic and former academic, spent 20 months in jail after   joining the Tiananmen Square pro-reform protests in 1989. He was also sent to a   re-education through labour camp in the 1990s.</p>
