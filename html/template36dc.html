    <td colspan="2"> <p><textarea rows="32" cols="105" style="font-size:10pt; color:blue; ">尊敬的奥巴马总统阁下及美国政府相关人士：

我们获悉，中国国家副主席习近平于2月13日正式访问美国。据“新华网”消息，外交部副部长崔天凯9日在北京表示：“习近平副主席访问美国旨在落实两国元首共识，进一步推动相互尊重、互利共赢的中美合作伙伴关系建设。”我们呼吁美国政府本着尊重人权与维护自由的核心价值观，运用其国际影响力，在中国领导人习近平访问美国时，向其提出关注中国近年不断恶化的言论自由和人权状况的话题，促使中国政府释放包括诺贝尔和平奖得主刘晓波在内的所有因言获罪的良心犯，我们特别提请贵国政府关注以下案例：

1、中国是目前唯一关押“诺贝尔和平奖”得主的国家，甚至株连、软禁被关押者家属。中国知名作家、独立中文笔会前任会长和荣誉会长刘晓波博士因其批评性文章和参与起草呼吁中国政府实行政治改革和改善人权状况的《零八宪章》，于2008年12月被捕，并在2009年圣诞节被以“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”判刑11年，他于2010年荣获“诺贝尔和平奖”，但这无助于改善其处境，刘至今已经被囚三年多，尚面临长达近八年的余刑。甚至在其获得诺奖消息宣布后，其妻刘霞也被单独软禁与外界失去联系，至今已超过一年。

2、去年圣诞节以来，中国当局在不到一个月内以“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”连续判处三位作家陈卫、陈西和李铁9至10年重刑，另一作家朱虞夫则因其一首呼吁在中国发起“茉莉花”集会的诗歌《是时候了》及接受境外媒体采访、为其他良心犯发起募捐等而于2月10日被以同样罪名判刑7年。陈卫、陈西和朱虞夫三人均因其和平的言论表达和异议活动第三度被判刑入狱。

3、中国当局在去年底宣布将在2006年被以“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”判处缓刑的著名维权律师高智晟重新收监执行实刑，并通知家属其被关押在新疆沙雅监狱，却违反相关规定拒绝远道而来的高智晟家属探监，致使其家人至今不能确知高智晟的准确下落和状况。

4、内蒙古蒙古族作家哈达在被以“分裂国家”等罪名判处15年长刑并于2010年12月应刑满获释后，继续被当局关押在不明地点至今，其妻儿亦被株连捏造罪名关押；山东盲人维权律师陈光诚在被当局判刑4年3个月于2010年9月刑满获释后，与家人一直受到当局有组织的严厉软禁、隔绝与外界联系至今，前去山东陈光诚家探视的数百名中外人士不断遭到当局组织的看守人员的暴力殴打、抢劫、绑架、羁押。

5、知名作家、独立中文笔会前副会长余杰于近期抵达美国并寻求政治庇护，据其抵美后公开披露的信息，他在刘晓波获“诺贝尔和平奖”消息宣布后曾遭到公安人员非法绑架并被酷刑折磨、凌辱长达数十小时，直至其休克濒死送医急救。我们从不同渠道获悉，去年“茉莉花”以来被捕人士在被关押期间，多人曾遭遇不同程度的酷刑折磨和人身侮辱，这严重违反中国相关法律和中国政府已签署的联合国《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》。

我们知悉，美国国会曾就刘晓波、高智晟等人权案件通过决议，呼吁中国政府立即释放他们。我们请求美国政府本着尊重人权与维护自由的核心价值观，发挥其国际影响力，在中国领导人习近平访问美国时向其提出有关中国人权状况的话题，并采取如下行动：

1、要求中国政府立即无条件释放刘晓波等所有系狱作家和其他良心犯，立即向外界公布之前被长期“失踪”的维权律师高智晟的真实状况并尊重其家人的合法探视权，立即依法恢复哈达、陈光诚等的人身自由，并停止对家属的株连、打压。

2、要求中国政府依法保障系狱作家和良心犯在关押期间的合法权利，包括其依法上诉的权利、家人探视权利和疾病医疗的需要，并免于酷刑虐待和人身侮辱。

我们相信，关切全世界人民的正义与人权，不但符合美国的核心价值与利益，也是美国作为一个有影响力的大国所应承担的国际责任。因此，我们期待着美国政府拿出更强有力的行动，促使中国政府改善其人权状况，尊重其本国公民享有中国宪法和相关国际公约保障的言论自由等基本人权。

Statement on Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's visit to the United States
February 14, 2012

Dear Mr. President Obama and related officials in the US government, 

We have learned that, Xi Jinping, vice president of China, will be visiting the US on February 13. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi “would seek consensus between leaders of the two nations during his visit to promote further the establishment of China-US cooperative partnership that is mutually respective and beneficial.” We call for the government of the United States to discuss with Xi the serious deterioration of freedom of expression and human rights conditions in China, and demand the Chinese government to release all prisoners of conscience, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. We wish to bring the following cases to your attention in particular:

1. China is the only country that imprisons a Nobel Peace Prize winner and house arrests his wife at the same time. A renowned writer and former president of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, Dr. Liu Xiaobo was arrested in December, 2008, for his writings that criticize the Chinese communist government and for his role in drafting the 08 Charter calling for political reform and improvement of human rights. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison on the Christmas day, 2009, for “inciting to subvert state power.” He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 but it didn’t help to improve his situation. What’s more, the Chinese government cut off his wife Liu Xia’s contact with the outside world, and it’s been more than one and half year that no one has heard from her. 

2. Within less than one month since last Christmas, the Chinese government has tried and sentenced three writers (in three separate trials)—Chen Wei, Chen Xi and Li Tie—to 9 or 10 years prison term for their writings that advocate freedom, human rights and democracy. Zhu Yufu, a 59-year-old writer and poet, was sentenced to 7 years in prison on February 10, in Hangzhou, for writing a poem that urges citizens to join the “Jasmine Movement”- walk, and for his being interviewed by foreign media, and raising money for prisoners of conscience. 

3. The disappear of the lawyer Gao Zhisheng is one of the most notorious case . For years Gao has been kidnapped, tortured and kept in unknown place by the Chinese security police. In 2006, he was sentenced to 5-year probation for “inciting to subvert state power.” In December, only days before his probation was due to end, the Chinese authority “took him back” to prison for violating probation terms while he was, for most of the part during the probation, either in police custody or under surveillance. His family was notified of his re-imprisonment in Shaya Prison in remote Xinjiang, but when his older brother travelled thousands of miles to visit him, the brother was denied visit which is allowed according to the prison regulation. Till today the family does not know of Gao Zhisheng’s whereabouts and his conditions. 

4. After serving 15 years in prison for “separatism” and other charges, the ethnic Mongolian writer Hada was due to be released in December, 2010, but he has continued to be held in undisclosed location by the Chinese authorities, and his wife and children were also detained under fictitious charges. Similarly, the blind rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng in Shandong, released from prison in September, 2010, after serving more than 4 years, was placed under strict house arrest along with his wife and family, completely cut off from the outside world. Hundreds of Chinese and foreign visitors have tried to visit Chen Guangcheng, but have been beaten, robbed, detained, or driven away. 

5. Yu Jie, a renowned writer and former vice-president of the Independent Chinese PEN Center who recently arrived in the US to seek political asylum, revealed how he was kidnapped and tortured shortly after Liu Xiaobo was announced the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. We have learned from various sources that people who were arrested last year during the aborted Jasmine movement have been subjected to torture as well. It is a flagrant violation of Chinese law as well as UN’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that China signed. 

The US Congress has passed resolutions to call for the release of Liu Xiaobo and Gao Zhisheng, yet we see nearly any reaction from China. It is clear that more needs to be done on the part of the US, should US wants to emphasize its core values of civil rights and freedoms in front of the world. We urge the American government to exert its international influence and treat human rights issue as a priority in discussions with Mr. Xi Jinping. We urge the US government to take the following actions: 

1. Ask the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release Liu Xiaobo and all other prisoners of conscience; announce publicly the real status of the long-disappeared rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, and grant his family the lawful rights to visit him; immediately give freedom back to Hada and Chen Guangcheng, and stop oppression against their families. 

2. Ask the Chinese government to respect the lawful rights of prisoners of conscience during their imprisonment, including their right to appeal, right to receive family visit, right to receive medical treatment, and free of torture.

We believe that it is not only for its values, but also to its interest, that the United States be concerned with justice and human rights across the globe. It is an international obligation that the US must fulfill. We look forward to America taking stronger actions against China in terms of the human rights conditions, to make sure the Chinese government respects basic human rights, which is documented in its own constitution as well as in international laws.
